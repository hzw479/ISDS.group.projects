5,"You really cannot complain about Ran, who is so energetic and nice. Yes,he does have an accent, but there are much much worse cases in the econ department at Stanford. Ran paces himself reasonably that it is easy to follow. His lecture slides are very clear.",4.5,3.0,"Aug 28th, 2008",808495
6,"Really clear, and really cares about whether students are learning.",5.0,2.0,"Apr 27th, 2008",808495
7,Extremely clear teaching style. Made concepts really easy to understand. Midterm and final were definitely easy but it was kind of nice not to come out feeling like you had failed.,4.0,2.0,"Dec 11th, 2007",808495
8,"He's really nice but this econ course in general was ambiguous and I didn't enjoy it.  He's probably better than the other profs though.  Another thing that bugged me--he would take all qns from students and try to remember everyone's names.  It was a waste of lecture time, esp since students would ask stupid qns just to be noticed.",4.0,2.0,"Mar 1st, 2007",808495

12,"Ran is a great professor. He really cares abour students and it shows. Also, he has a wonderful sly sense of humor. He says that his exams are fair, and it's true-- he only sticks to what was covered in lecture or homework. He'll also give advice on anything econ-related. Thumbs-up!",5.0,3.0,"Mar 16th, 2006",808495
13,love Abrams!! He's very thought provoking and the grading is lenient if you are thoughtful in your papers. He let me do the work and be interested without having to worry about my grade too much.,4.5,1.0,"Aug 3rd, 2015",925287
14,"While the class wasn't particularly hard to do well in, it didn't need to be. Professor Abrams inspires his students to be better at everything they do, including in this class. I thoroughly enjoyed both classes I took with him, and I would highly recommend anything he is teaching, even if it is not in your area of study.",5.0,2.0,"Aug 2nd, 2010",925287

17,"Great professor, engaging class.  He wouldn't just lecture, he'd get conversations and debates started.  The class is pretty easy-- it's easy to get away with not doing the reading, and he practically tells you how to pass the final, but it was a fantastic class.  More than any other class at Stanford, this one taught me a new way to think.",5.0,1.0,"Aug 27th, 2007",925287

22,Had three courses from her when I was a student.  One of my favorites at law school because of her dedication and sincerity.  Actually made Civ Pro come to life for me.

28,"Clear expectations, friendly, professional. Goes out of her way to make class interesting and engaging, and to remind students when stuff is due. Gives access to plenty of resources. Always seeks feedback on teaching. Brings in breakfast for everyone sometimes.",4.5,4.0,"Dec 10th, 2013",1655665
29,"Teacher was confusing, unhelpful, unfriendly and not nice. She is a rigid grader yet it is extremely confusing to figure out what she wants so you can not discern what guidelines she is actually imposing and what she really wants! I wish I had saved myself the time, money and aggravation and not taken this course!",1.0,3.0,"Jul 23rd, 2013",1655665

33,Disastrous course taught by a petty instructor!,1.0,5.0,"Apr 8th, 2021",2023724
34,Worse than a class that doesn't teach you anything is one where the instructor belittles his students. Altman achieves both perfectly. Save yourself and don't take his courses.,1.0,5.0,"Mar 25th, 2021",2023724
35,Awful course. Poorly managed and poorly taught course. Surprised it is even offered at a place like Stanford,1.0,5.0,"Mar 10th, 2021",2023724
36,Recommend staying far away from this one.,1.0,5.0,"Mar 3rd, 2021",2023724
37,"Didn't learn anything. A way to burn through a course. Instructor has a strange teaching style. Lectures were never prepared, seemed like instructor just ranted about whatever was on his mind day of lecture. First lecture he made a derogatory comment then laughed. Should have dropped then.",1.0,5.0,"Feb 8th, 2021",2023724
38,Disastrously taught course with lack of grading criteria and uninformative lectures. It was pretty clear neither the students nor Altman wanted to be there. Recommend hiring an instructor who likes teaching to teach this course material.,1.0,5.0,"Jan 25th, 2021",2023724

40,Poor instructor who took away from any delight in learning the material.,1.0,5.0,"Jan 8th, 2021",2023724
41,"I was interested in his class because he is a professor of bioengineering, genetics, medicine, biomedical data science, and computer science. Unfortunately he taught us nothing about these subjects. Odd teaching style and fails to inspire students. Agreed with the other remarks here, by far the worst class at Stanford.",1.0,5.0,"Jan 5th, 2021",2023724
42,"Uninspiring teacher who lectures about a bunch of irrelevant material that are of interest to him that day. Not accessible outside of class. Not able to provide any feedback on his grading criteria, appears there is none. I would be okay listening to hours of irrelevant lectures if he appeared to care for his students who want to learn.",1.0,5.0,"Jan 5th, 2021",2023724
43,"He doesn't use a textbook. Unsure how grades are determined. Left the course without learning anything. I wouldn't say tough grader, because again I'm not sure how grades are even determined. Course material is scattered. Worst class at Stanford.",1.0,5.0,"Jan 5th, 2021",2023724
44,I don't think Altman likes teaching or students,1.0,5.0,"Jan 4th, 2021",2023724
