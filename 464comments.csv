0,Peter Achinstein is one of the best philosophy professors that Johns Hopkins has to offer.,5.0,3.0,"Apr 7th, 2019",842746
1,Don't take intro to logic. I went to this guy and both of the tas when I was failing the course and they offered no help. Makes you buy his own book which doesnt have an answer key for non homework problems like any normal math book. This makes it so you can't do add. practice outside of the ridiculous hw grades you on for 25% of your cumulative.,1.5,5.0,"May 3rd, 2013",842746
2,He fails you if you miss one homework assignment. There is no curve and the homework assignments (worth 25% of your final grade) are difficult. The tests are straightforward but he likes to make the final hard. Not very many As...,4.5,5.0,"May 25th, 2012",842746
3,"Intro to formal logic. Great teacher, quite funny at times, but it irks me so much when he misses a spot while erasing the blackboard (which is ALL THE TIME). Make sure you have a good TA because the HW problems can be HARD. He likes to challenge you with HW problems harder than any example done in class. Tests are doable. Little to no reading.",5.0,3.0,"Apr 14th, 2011",842746
4,Awesome teacher. I've never seen a prof encourage so much discussion while always keeping it on topic. Encourages serious thinking and really challenges his students. Best of all - he's really there for the students... caring and always willing to give his insight.,4.5,5.0,"May 4th, 2010",842746
5,Definately only means for Philosophy Majors.  Do not take without at least a BA in philosophy.,2.5,4.0,"Dec 5th, 2006",842746
6,"Awesome teacher, just make sure you do the homework,; if you miss just one, he fails you.",5.0,3.0,"May 4th, 2006",842746
7,"Adler expects a lot, but he makes it a priority to get to know all of his students so he is more understanding. Make sure to read his instructions. He grades fairly. I would take another class taught by him.",4.0,3.0,"Mar 5th, 2016",2109481
8,"Prof. Agarwala is truly amazing! She dedicates a lot of time and effort to help her students succeed both academically and personally. You should be prepared to read a lot and engage deeply with the materials. Also expect to think about things in new ways, which might be challenging + take getting used to but that's a part of intellectual growth!",5.0,4.0,"May 12th, 2021",1499494

10,"Professor Agarwala's class is mostly discussion-based, some led by her and some by students. The material is challenging but she's super smart and a fantastic teacher and I learned a lot, even though it was a lot of work. Would and will take a class with her again!",5.0,3.0,"Apr 24th, 2017",1499494
11,Best teacher I've had at Hopkins. Worth taking a class to have her as a teacher.,5.0,3.0,"Apr 8th, 2014",1499494
12,Took Issues in International Studies.  Great class.,5.0,4.0,"Nov 2nd, 2011",1499494
13,"Excellent teacher, great lecturer. Make sure to go to class since she does not post slides online. Also, her biggest pet peeve is people not doing the readings so make sure to do them even though there's a lot. Her classes are really well organized and interesting.",5.0,3.0,"Nov 21st, 2010",1499494
14,"Great teacher, very organized class and very helpful through email and office hours. Top on my list for sociology professors.",,,,1499494
15,Worst teacher ever. Boring. Not understandable. Moody.,1.0,4.0,"Dec 20th, 2010",1464017
16,"Impossible to understand. If you have to take calc, take it during covered grades because it is impossible to learn anything from him, let alone get a good grade. SWITCH TO ANOTHER PROF",1.0,5.0,"Dec 10th, 2010",1464017
17,"worst professor ever. killed my morale and my GPA. do NOT take any class with alan, i've had to learn everything by myself. also his exams are multiple choice, which is really dumb for a math class",1.5,5.0,"Nov 11th, 2010",1464017
18,Hard to understand (its the Turkish accent) and not welcoming. Has a strange sense of humor probably due to language barrier.,2.0,1.0,"Oct 29th, 2010",1464017
19,cant understand anything he says. moves way too fast. does not walk thru new material. im dying,1.0,5.0,"Oct 18th, 2010",1464017
20,Can't understand a word this guy says. My TA would be a far better prof.,1.5,3.0,"Sep 15th, 2010",1464017
21,,1.0,4.0,"Aug 10th, 2010",1464017
22,Most important class I took as this class built a foundation for the other engineering classes I took. Hedy is a great professor and really cares that you learn. He's easy to approach and gives really great lectures--but you must do your part.,5.0,4.0,"Nov 15th, 2016",1737234
23,"Hedy is knowledgeable, attentive professor toward his students, and a good and caring mentor.  You definitely have to put you effort in class to succeed.  He us a fair grader, yet, expect earnest effort.  He will let you know if your performance is subpar.  Good professor!",4.0,4.0,"Nov 10th, 2016",1737234
24,"Hedy is my favorite professor here at Hopkins. He's extremely caring, and on top of that, an amazing professor. EnvE is a lot of tough work, and he always makes sure that his students understand the material.",4.5,2.0,"Mar 30th, 2016",1737234
25,"Although EnvE is a lot of work, Hedy is a great professor for the course. He's so funny, easygoing, and really cares about his students. He always greets his students when they come in (""Hello,  I missed you!"" or ""How are you doing?""). He makes sure his students are paying attention and truly cares that they are getting a good education. ",3.5,3.0,"Nov 4th, 2014",1737234
26,"Dr. Alavi is very knowledgeable and helpful. Though, to have a good grade, you need to do your part.",5.0,4.0,"Aug 9th, 2014",1737234
27,Hedy is wonderful with Intro to Environmental Engineering. Definitely more work than I anticipated but he definitely just wants you to be interested and learn the overall concepts not the equations and numbers. Great class when you stay awake...,3.5,2.0,"Nov 10th, 2012",1737234
28,Tim is very knowledgeable and flexible as far as meeting times go. This was especially important since most AAP students are located in different time zones.,4.5,3.0,"May 17th, 2016",2146060
29,learned very little from the professor had to teach my self from the book in order to pass,1.5,4.0,"Mar 19th, 2016",1251835
30,a good professor,5.0,1.0,"Dec 29th, 2014",1251835
31,"He's the best professor ever, he was very good about feedback and our entire group loved and respected him by the end of the semester",5.0,4.0,"Oct 31st, 2017",2042185
32,"Prof. Altschul is extremely warm and friendly. She conducts class completely in Spanish and speaks at a native pace so be prepared for that. Class had an extremely manageable amount of reading - some reading was in English, some in Spanish. Overall, I had a great experience with her and would definitely take a class with her in the future.",4.0,2.0,"Oct 23rd, 2011",1629849
33,"I didn't go to many classes, but when I did go, he sounded pretty clear to me. He wants you to learn, and the hws are fair (except for one problem every once in a while). Exams are straightforward. You will have to work in his class, but he doesn't overload you with crap. His handwriting could be better.",3.5,3.0,"May 7th, 2010",1175325
34,"He's very bright, but sometimes has trouble explaining complex concepts clearly in lecture. You'll do well if you keep up with the material. Some homework problems are just unfair, but that's probably the way it is with any math class.",3.5,3.0,"Apr 22nd, 2010",1175325
35,Be prepared for difficult questions in the exams,3.0,4.0,"Apr 19th, 2009",1175325
36,"Class is challenging, but Ambro does a better job than most at explaining the material. He has an accent, but if you're not American you can understand him better, also because foreigners are generally accustomed to a more systematic, learning-based system rather than memorization. He is very helpful if you take the time to talk to him.",4.0,4.0,"Dec 26th, 2008",1175325
37,"His class was difficult but not impossible. He is not mean spirited, and he does want his class to learn. He has received poor ratings due probably to his inexperience with teaching.",3.0,5.0,"Dec 15th, 2008",1175325
38,It is really hard for me to understand what he is saying,2.0,4.0,"Dec 12th, 2008",1175325
39,He's obviously a gifted mathematician.  That said he should never be allowed to teach.  I'd learn more math by staring at a broken TI-83+ for an hour.,1.0,3.0,"Dec 5th, 2008",1175325
40,"Don't bother going to class, it won't help at all.  You're better off teaching yourself the material.  If I hadn't taken calculus in high school I would have failed the class. He's a terrible teacher.",1.0,5.0,"Nov 23rd, 2008",1175325
41,Class is difficult and close to a waste of time.  Teaches at a very quick speed andn does not explain material well at all.  The book can be difficult to understand but is a necessity as it is basically the only way to learn the material.Tests are difficult and the problems on both test and book are harder than examples from class.,1.5,5.0,"Nov 22nd, 2008",1175325
42,"Pretty funny sometimes, and makes sense if you can follow what he's doing, but a lot of times the homework problems are a lot harder than the examples he gives in class.",3.5,3.0,"Nov 20th, 2008",1175325
43,Terrible calc 2 teacher. Class is a waste of time; you are better off skipping and teaching yourself from the book. Be prepared for tests that challenge your intelligence more than your knowledge.,1.0,4.0,"Nov 12th, 2008",1175325
44,Surprised by the poor review.  This professor has several years of experience in InfoSec and keeps the discussions and assignments relevant to current technology and trends. Combination in-class and online discussions that are interesting.  Short papers weekly and long group paper due at the end.  Worthwhile experience for a foundations course.,5.0,3.0,"Sep 23rd, 2013",1829170
45,Terrible instructor. Does not know material. Told class we needed to read her mind. Seems to do a reverse curve to keep most people from getting an A. Grading arbitrary.,1.0,5.0,"Aug 19th, 2013",1829170
46,"Scolds people who ask ""dumb"" questions, discouraging to those who don't already know the content.",1.0,5.0,"Mar 2nd, 2015",1346305
47,Great professor.  Extremely helpful. Very hands on. Sincerely interested in students.,5.0,3.0,"Apr 6th, 2014",1346305
48,Very difficult. Demands things to be done his way. However you will learn how to code.,2.5,5.0,"Nov 1st, 2011",1346305
49,No Comments,5.0,5.0,"Oct 30th, 2009",1346305
50,"The whole Archaeology department is just lovely, but Dr Anderson is something else. She is so caring, the class is never dull, and in addition to her heartwarming character she is incredibly experienced and knowledgeable. If you get the chance to take any of her 2.5 hour classes in the archaeology museum, take one, no matter your major.",5.0,3.0,"Apr 4th, 2018",1746849
51,"Any class by Anderson is going to be incredible! She is sweet, personable, and you really learn the material via discussion and interaction.  If you are an archaeology major or not you HAVE to take one of her classes! AS.040.218(01)",4.5,3.0,"Sep 7th, 2012",1746849
52,Prof. Andreas is super kind and relaxed. He is a great lecturer and I learned so much in one semester with him. If you put in some effort you will come out with an A. highly recommend his class,5.0,2.0,"Dec 24th, 2018",1298301
53,"Professor Andreas makes what could be a very dry subject - sociological theories of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber - interesting and relevant. The class involves a decent amount of reading and writing, but it's graded fairly, and class participation is also factored into your final grade.",5.0,2.0,"Nov 22nd, 2009",1298301
54,The professor spent lecture time explaining things (badly) that were tangentially related to the course and when asked a question about something actually important would laugh at you and tell you to read the book.  No wonder every project got an extension; he didn't explain how to do projects until the day they were due.,1.0,3.0,"Jun 14th, 2012",1674137
55,"Professor Angelini is highly knowledgable on the many disparate subsets of anthropology and is an expert purveyor in interesting ideas. This class is basically like more concrete philosophy in that you regularly write, discuss and consider ideas on many topics within anthro. He is also an extremely kind human being. At times, it gets too political.",5.0,2.0,"Sep 17th, 2020",2535496

57,"Prof Angelini is so amazing. He is so well versed and is very passionate and intelligent in his field, he gave amazing lectures that were extremely insightful and interesting. He asks for participation in classes but he makes it so easy and interesting to participate it doesn't matter. If you are at all interested in anthro/culture, take his class",,,,2535496
58,"Only lecture I actually looked forward to going to on Monday/Wednesday/Friday mornings... great guy, very funny, and absolutely adorable",5.0,2.0,"Dec 15th, 2013",1723899
59,"This dude is adorable. It was worth it to take the class for his adorable nerdiness. Other than that, the content gets hard quickly, and the class is hard to follow. Campus studyand help services are definitely a must, at least for me.....",4.0,3.0,"Nov 22nd, 2013",1723899
60,Very enthusiastic and good at explaining the concepts. Tests are hard but if you do the homework and the practice problems you will succeed. Class is enjoyable because of his obvious enthusiasm and his fantastic one-liners.,4.5,3.0,"Nov 17th, 2013",1723899
61,"Very easy to understand, and gives lots of examples. He is also very enthusiastic, which goes a long way in a math course. The tests are extremely fair, and you will be well prepared if you do the homework problems again as a means of studying. The best math teacher i have had at Hopkins so far.",5.0,2.0,"Nov 15th, 2013",1723899
62,Very nice person.,4.5,4.0,"Dec 19th, 2012",1723899
63,"Great professor,also a great person.",5.0,4.0,"Dec 7th, 2012",1723899
64,Very enthuastic and helpful. He wants you to succeede. If you put the time in you will get a good grade.,4.5,3.0,"Jul 27th, 2012",1723899
65,"Slight accent, but by no means impairs his teaching. Basically says everything the book says, just makes it more clear, so lecture isn't completely mandatory. Very enthusiastic, which makes it a bit easier to pay attention. He's pretty helpful and his jokes are funny because of certain malapropisms. When it comes to math, not a bad teacher at all.",4.0,2.0,"May 17th, 2012",1723899
66,Engaging lecture style with clear motivation for every class. Super accessible for addition help. Very willing to write recommendation letters if you knows you well enough.,5.0,3.0,"May 15th, 2012",1723899
67,Professor Armitage is great.   Nice guy and very clear.   His lectures are engaging and I really liked going to class.,5.0,3.0,"Jun 2nd, 2017",1685969
68,"Although Professor Armitage tends to be a bit scattered on occasion, if I judge this class by what I actually learned this was one of the very best at JHU.   I never really ""got"" physics before, but in this class I think I finally understood what it was all about.  He has a unique way of explaining and getting inside physics that clicked with me.",5.0,3.0,"Jun 10th, 2016",1685969
69,Professor Armitage wants the students to succeed.  The material is hard though.  He has extensive office hours which are helpful.,4.0,3.0,"Apr 7th, 2015",1685969
70,"The only thing I would say is that although he says you can look at old exams online to see what his exams are like that is not really true.   A much better guide to his exams are the homework problems.  Some people complained that he put identical problems from HW on the exams, but I don't really see how this is a bad thing.",4.0,3.0,"Dec 6th, 2013",1685969
71,"I took Prof. Armitage for 105.  I'd had AP physics previously, but I learned much more in this awesome class.  Great professor!",4.5,4.0,"Jul 21st, 2012",1685969
72,"Hard class, but good.  You'll definitely learn alot, but you will have to work.  He is an enthusiastic lecturer.",4.0,4.0,"Jan 17th, 2012",1685969
73,"I loved having Aronhime. He's very eloquent, quite funny, and truly cares about the material and his students. Grading on exams and quizzes can be tough but you truly learn a lot. I'd definitely enjoy having him as my prof again.",1.0,5.0,"Apr 17th, 2021",329960
74,"SO much homework  8 hours a week for this one class. Attendance and participation in discussion (camera on) is mandatory, but most of the time he drones on and on. It is unclear what we have to know versus what he is discussing for his own fun. This class made me cry multiple times and I reconsidered my minor twice.",5.0,3.0,"Jan 13th, 2021",329960
75,"I loved having Aronhime. He's very eloquent, quite funny, and truly cares about the material and his students. Grading on exams and quizzes can be tough but you truly learn a lot. I'd definitely enjoy having him as my prof again.",4.0,3.0,"May 15th, 2020",329960
76,Thought his teaching style was pretty ineffective while I was in class but looking back I actually learned a lot.,4.0,3.0,"Apr 9th, 2020",329960
77,"There is no textbooks but there are readings for every class online and he will give reading quizzes if he doesn't think people have read. Curve is based on section. Case studies are difficult, regular assignments are not. You get a cheat sheet for the exam which is how you do the entire test, so do not procrastinate on them they will save you.",1.0,2.0,"Mar 4th, 2020",329960
78,I found Professor Aronhime to be a rude and aloof Professor. He gave off an arrogant attitude that made the teaching quality in class poor. I think he lacks the guts to be humble and look at himself as being there to help students rather than self-aggrandize.,5.0,3.0,"Nov 9th, 2018",329960
79,"Fall 2017. This was back when it was a writing intensive class, which made the amount of work a bit excessive. Lectures were super interesting, with easy reading quizzes about once a week. Aronhime definitely is one of the better professors, because he actually has real world experience in the subject matters he taught. Curve is based on section.",5.0,3.0,"May 7th, 2018",329960
80,"Aronhime is probably the most interesting professor I've had so far at Hopkins. Unlike most of the professors here, he has real world experience that he uses to enhance lectures. His lectures are always interesting (even in a boring class like Financial Accounting), because he ties in stories about his experiences as an accountant and manager.",5.0,2.0,"Jan 6th, 2018",329960
81,The lectures were always the most insightful and interesting things to sit through. Very wise man. BUT: an ample amount of busywork Advise: If Aronhime changes his voice an octave lower.. probably understand the statement fundamentally with some examples for exams. Favorite professor so far at Hopkins. Put some effort in and the A will come.,4.0,3.0,"Dec 20th, 2016",329960
82,awesome guy,4.0,3.0,"Apr 9th, 2015",329960
83,"Lectures aren't helpful in terms of testgrade, but they are enjoyable to sit through. You can learn a lot about how the business world works from him, but I'm not talking about the test material. His stories, insight, and lectures teach much more than his powerpoints and tests. In fact, I would say his tests are unnecessarily obscure.",5.0,3.0,"Dec 6th, 2011",329960
84,Aronhime knows how to keep students interested and motivated. He is an incredibly fascinating man with a true depth of knowledge in business and beyond. He has much to offer the students of Johns Hopkins.,4.0,5.0,"Jul 22nd, 2011",329960
85,Way too much work. Far too much homework and way too hard on the grading. His intro to business class is easy though.,5.0,2.0,"May 24th, 2011",329960
86,"Professor Aronhime is great - go to class, sit in the front of the lecture and take it all in. Its a decent amount of work but its not difficult!",4.5,2.0,"Apr 15th, 2011",329960
87,"He is an extremely interesting and engaging professor. There is no textbook, instead he lectures from PowerPoint Slides. Midterms are multiple choice and relatively challenging, but you get a cheat sheet. I highly recommend this course to everyone!",5.0,3.0,"Apr 13th, 2011",329960
88,"Excellent accounting teacher. He was able to explain the principles of accounting in a clear way and show you how things work in the real world. Great at explaining, bringing context to questions and asks great questions that really make you think. Highly rate him.",5.0,2.0,"Apr 13th, 2011",329960
89,Very interesting knows what he's talking about,4.0,2.0,"Apr 22nd, 2010",329960

91,Love his stories. The tests are pretty easy.,5.0,2.0,"Jan 28th, 2009",329960

97,"Astin is respectful to his students and covers material that is generally interesting to read and think about. During his lectures, he tends to get off track and go on random tangents. He has a good sense of humor and knows a lot about theater and film. Though sometimes his classes become redundant, overall I recommend.",4.5,1.0,"Nov 16th, 2004",357849
98,He has a great way of making everyone feel like they're his favorite student.,4.5,1.0,"Oct 14th, 2004",357849
99,"Course is easy and not stressful at all.  Astin tends to go on tangents about anything, and as long as you don't mind that, you'll enjoy the course.  The classes tend to be large, so there is less stage time for everybody.  Doing scenes was the best part.",5.0,3.0,"Jul 3rd, 2004",357849
100,"He is kind, funny, passionate and enthusiastic about what he's teaching. He is also brilliant; best acting coach I have had.",,,,357849

103,"Pretty bad professor overall. Doesn't respond to emails, office hours almost useless and has a god-complex while teaching. Take LADE with another professor if you can (he also teaches prob stats for bio and for engineers).",1.5,5.0,"Dec 18th, 2015",2059693
104,"Avanti's classes are really hard but once you get the hang of things, you find that you actually learn a lot in her class! Her homeworks are long, so she should work ahead of time and study a little each day. But she's actually very helpful during office hours and an overall very caring professor.",5.0,4.0,"Mar 23rd, 2019",1732926
105,Avanti is one of the best professors I've had at Hopkins! The homeworks and tests can be hard but as long as you work outside of class and meet with her a few times you should do well.,5.0,3.0,"Aug 15th, 2018",1732926
106,"Lectures are well organized and provide interesting information. That said, the work load for this course is ridiculous. Prepare to spend about 15 hours a week on HW assignments. Tests focus on the application of the material despite mostly derivations focused on in class. Go to office hours as she will explain in great detail the HW answers.",2.0,5.0,"May 26th, 2018",1732926

1081,I took Shakespeare: Then and Now and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was not previously interested in Shakespeare however the lectures were entertaining and offered a way to actually understand the plays on a more profound level. The reading pace is rigorous (a play a week) but it is very manageable.,5.0,2.0,"Nov 20th, 2010",968628
1082,"Also took Shakespeare: Then and Now... Halpern is thoroughly entertaining in his lectures but the TAs are incompetent and the grading was unfair. For a 100 level class that should be easy, this course--and Halpern-- took themselves a little too seriously.",4.5,4.0,"Mar 19th, 2009",968628
1083,"I took ""Shakespeare: Then and Now"" with him. Class moves very fast. Great lectures, but TA was bad. HARD TESTS!!! Midterm and final ask you to identify speaker of quotes from a NUMBER of plays. Don't take it. HARD!!!",3.5,5.0,"Nov 2nd, 2007",968628
1084,I love professor Hamilton. He's one of the best professor's I've ever had. He really helped me understand economics in his office hours.,3.0,4.0,"May 18th, 2020",20923
1085,"The class is grades by two quizzes, midterm, and final. The final will be worth 50% of the grade so you should really take it seriously. The professor holds about 6 office hours per week. Be able to teach the class.",5.0,3.0,"May 18th, 2020",20923

1087,I don't understand why people dislike Hamilton so much. He was a very clear lecturer and helped me to really solidify the concepts. He also seemed to be a genuinely nice guy.,5.0,4.0,"Apr 30th, 2020",20923
1088,"Oftentimes, Hamilton is one of the first professors students meet who requires that you work hard to do well in the class. BUT if you put in the time and effort the class is not only enjoyable and engaging, but Hamilton is a fantastic professor and mentor outside of the classroom. His courses are always the first to fill up.",3.0,4.0,"Apr 9th, 2020",20923
1089,"Decent lecturer but can be boring at 9am. Get to know your TAs because they get to decide if you are curved. Had a background in micro which made the class a lot easier but can be difficult with no background in econ. There are no assignments, just two quizzes, midterm, and final, so you need to do well on these exams to do well in the class.",1.0,3.0,"Mar 4th, 2020",20923

1091,"Hamilton is hands down the worst professor at Hopkins. He started off his very first lecture with ""a lot of people complain about me but it doesn't matter because I'm chair of the department."" He rarely responds to emails, and if he does it's rude. Avoid this class at all costs. It almost made me leave Hopkins.",1.0,1.0,"Sep 30th, 2019",20923

1093,I didn't find Bruce very hard in Micro Elements. His lectures were clear & the concepts were not difficult; grading was harsh but not unfair. I never had to go to learning den/read the textbook. You'll find the class straightforward if you're already inclined to paying attention to detail. Also TAs have influence on your final grade so kiss up,4.0,3.0,"Aug 24th, 2017",20923
1094,"The material is not particularly difficult, but Hamilton is specific with his grading. He does recycle test questions so study the back tests and show your answers to a TA who's done the class before thus is familiar with his grading.  Go to lecture. He explains things clearly and logically.  There are no assignments which is nice",2.0,4.0,"Dec 7th, 2016",20923
1095,He is a good lecturer and things will make sense but you will not get a good test grade unless you write an essay per question. His expectations for answers aren't clear and the TAs help as much as they can but ultimately fall short. The class isn't enjoyable because of the inability to do well. Also doesn't curve.,2.5,5.0,"Mar 24th, 2016",20923
1096,"He speaks clearly, which is the only good thing. Prof. Hamilton seems to get off on power, and because he is Lord King of Economics, he uses this position to harass all the underclassmen. His office hours are 7am, exams are filled with ""gotcha"" questions, and you have to beg and grovel for a good grade. Also, doesn't use online resources at all.",4.5,3.0,"Apr 28th, 2015",20923
1097,"While his class started out to be different from what I expected, Bruce helped me to get back on track and to give me the opportunity to work closely with him to bring up my grade, and to use helpful material to fully understand what I was missing. ",3.0,4.0,"Nov 14th, 2014",20923
1098,"Go to class, read all of the textbook (the Mankiw one) and go to Learning Den and you will do well. He explains things clearly and multiple times with well labeled graphs, but his grading is too specific. Just know what he is looking for and write exactly that.",1.0,5.0,"Mar 30th, 2013",20923
1099,"This professor does not really seem to care for the students. I got an A in his class but devoted all of my life to it... he is a terrible professor and really needs to leave hopkins, and he is not a nice guy at all, rather arrogant if you ask me and a majority of the class",2.0,4.0,"Jun 5th, 2012",20923

1102,An absolutely terrible prof/person. The book he forces you to buy (his of course) is horrible! There are whole pages that are just missing specific letters. I don't think anyone ever proofread it. Plus he thinks he is god when it comes to econ (yet teaches micro which is self-explanatory). He's arrogant and rude. I suggest macro if u have a choice,5.0,4.0,"May 24th, 2011",20923

1108,"Don't take him. Pretty much no one can understand him and good luck trying to go to his office hours (which is right after the lecture, right when most people have other classes to go to).

1109,"Practice tests were exactly like the real thing, just with different equations. That's about the only good thing about Prof. Han's class.

Little homework, but heavy reading.",4.5,4.0,"Oct 2nd, 2011",1175820
1114,"Clara is one of the best professors I had in four years at Hopkins.  I believe that some of the other comments stem from a failure to meet her admittedly high expectations.

Your choice.",1.5,5.0,"Jul 28th, 2011",1175820
1115,"Dr. Han was one of the worst professors I had during my time at Hopkins. She was extremely biased in her teachings, often refusing to consider a student's point of view.

1117,"Dr. Han, while bringing interesting readings to students' attention, is terrible at teaching. Her lectures are painful to sit through due to her incomprehensive, scattered speaking.

1118,"Clara Han is the most useless, lower than mediocre, insecure, teacher ever.

He doesn't feel the need to teach, his lectures are composed of nonsensical mumblings and imcomprehensible 'non-sequitur' style structure, and he is impossible to deal with on a personal level. He is self-absorbed, clearly (and openly) despises his students and teaching, and offers absolutely no help to students.",1.5,5.0,"Jul 20th, 2009",21274

3118,"Lectures are slow, unclear, hard to follow, and unorganized. He insists on getting sidetracked and making small, unfunny jokes.  Also spends the first two classes arguing why everything's the students' fault. Changed homework 5 days after assigning it, and then changes the due date to the next class, rather than a couple days later. Avoid.",1.0,5.0,"Sep 19th, 2008",21274

3122,"WORST TEACHER IN HISTORY. hates his students, does nothing to help them, and his lectures are painful. talks about unrelated topics, makes fun of students, and seems to resent teaching. i retook this class for a better grade after having him and got an A easily because the qualilty of the teacher was 100% better, which goes to show he is the worst",1.0,5.0,"Sep 6th, 2007",21274

3126,"It's not the fact that he blabs about stuff loosely related to math during lectures and assigns homework that has pretty much nothing to do with whats going on that pisses me off. Rather, its that while doing all this, he says, with a smile, that he intended to do so all along, and sees no reason why he actually has to teach.",1.5,5.0,"Feb 21st, 2007",21274
