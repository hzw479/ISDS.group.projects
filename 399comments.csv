3,His class was very unique. I really enjoyed being in the class. If you want high grade marks in the class then you must keep up with the reading and make sure you attend every class. If you show interest in the class and participate then you should be okay. He is such a nice person and is a genus.,5.0,1.0,"May 15th, 2014",1532353

I was humbled by his devotion to the class.  He is strict on attendance  & participation.",5.0,3.0,"Aug 4th, 2016",1406187
23,I  took Remo's Public Speaking class and have never had a better educational experience. He is completely dedicated to making all his students excel and the amount of time and energy he devoted to each and every one of us was astounding.
