10,she is very disorganized and does not give any tests. This is a plus to having no tests because you can sit on your lap top or eat food during the entire class and there won't be any negative repercussions. She is for sure an easy class but be prepared to keep yourself busy because the topics will put you to sleep. ,1.5,2.0,"Dec 4th, 2014",1368833
11,I loved her! I wish she would stay at WKU instead of going to PA! She def one of my fav professors! She does lock you out if you don't show up on time but it does stop interruptions. The tests are not hard. I enjoyed going to every class even though its not mandatory. I loved her personality!!,5.0,1.0,"May 16th, 2010",1368833
12,"She's gorgeous to me. Intimidating at first but very friendly. Must be on time to class or you are locked out. Attendance not mandatory but she does give out information that you will need on tests sometimes. Extra credit given. Tests are easy. No homework given. Ten reaction papers due, very easy.

22,"Homework was hard to understand, and didn't nearly always line up with the textbook. Grading was impossible to interpret, with little feedback as to what was wrong.

I was also 1 out of 3 females in his class, but he did not treat me unfairly.",2.0,2.0,"Jan 28th, 2021",2136814
23,"He's not that bad, but he relies heavily on his textbook and doesn't actually teach anything. I had an A the whole semester and at the end he accused me of cheating and gave me a bad grade on the final project. I won't get into too much detail, but I've lost all respect for him.",1.0,5.0,"Dec 16th, 2020",2136814
24,"I was one of 3 females in the class. I had coded in Python before (and had made him aware of that) so of course I would know more and all of my codes worked fine but he still counted points off, sometimes whole letter grades for ""doing things we hadnt covered in class"".

25,"If you study and take good notes you can do well in this class. The homework is graded generously, and you are allowed to look back at direct examples of programs for labs. The final was pretty difficult, however. Make sure you answer in-class questions as extra credit is given and really help your grade. Don't be shy and miss out on easy points!",1.0,5.0,"Dec 16th, 2019",2136814
26,I would never take this professor again in a million years. He's an EXTREMELY TOUGH grader and counts points off even if you do something a little extra. NOT an introductory course. DO NOT TAKE. SWITCH PROFS ASAP.,1.0,5.0,"Dec 16th, 2019",2136814
27,"Take a Different teacher or drop the class! THIS WAS NOT A INTRO CLASS! There was no textbook, homework was HARD to understand.

32,"He's a good professor. His exams are pretty tough (he only has two: midterm and final). There are labs every other week, two lab tests, and two projects. He gives bonuss point for participating in class, so participate. The points add up and can boost your grade A LOT.",4.0,3.0,"May 8th, 2019",2136814
33,"You get what you're paying for. This is an introductory course that challenges you in a good way, even if you are starting from ground zero with programming. Take the bonus points, they add up.

36,"Dr. Abumuhfouz is a very good professor who teaches the material very effectively. When you participate in class, he gives you ""bonus points"" which seem arbitrary, but over time accumulate and can make a huge impact on your grade. He can be unclear sometimes on assignments, and the homework often has errors, but overall he is a great professor.",1.0,5.0,"Dec 10th, 2018",2136814

38,Professor Abumuhfouz is a great professor. His lectures are very interesting and hands on. He gives out extra credit for class participation. His class is very tough however.

39,"I took programming for math credit to try something new. This was very difficult, and Ismail was very inconsistent on how hard the course actually was.

40,"Dr. Abumuhfouz teaches all of the material in long lectures and gives an insane amount of homework outside of class. You will probably spend the most time on this class with the amount of work he gives. The only good thing is he makes himself accessible outside of class, but once you understand the concepts, its still hard to do all the work.",5.0,3.0,"Jan 21st, 2018",2136814
41,"Ismail was a very good teacher. He gave plenty of opportunities for extra credit both from class participation and on every test. I really liked the class, but I had prior experience before the class. On blackboard he has the class's average grade shown; it was a 68%. This feels super low, but a lot of the students refused to do the work.",,,,2136814

46,"She's the kind of professor who eventually grows on you. So give it time. She is pretty nice, but you need to show a considerable amount of interest in her subject in order to seek help from her.

47,"Lighting class is useless. She barely does any hands on teaching, just tells you about how to do it, shows you some examples, expects you to do it all on your own.

63,Jonathan Adams is a wonderful person! He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He expects a lot out of you because he wants you to actually get a good education and learn a lot. He doesn't expect professional work from beginners; he just expects that you give a crap. I really learned a lot from him,5.0,4.0,"May 5th, 2019",1711059
64,"Horrible professor. Unprofessional. WILL make fun of you in front of the entire class if you have anything misspelled on draft work.

66,I took this class as an elective since I needed more hours and I thought it would be fun. Turns out Adams expects a ton out of his students and grades hard. No one in class is a PJ major yet he expects you to get insane photos like a baseball bat breaking and wont let you shoot people you know. Only stressed me out and lower my GPA. Expensive too.,1.0,4.0,"Mar 29th, 2018",1711059

She's condescending and messes up code constantly.,1.0,5.0,"Sep 21st, 2020",854674
12298,"Would avoid her if possible, especially around COVID era. She seems to overcompensate for hybrid classes so it feels like we have double the amount of homework. Homework is typically unhelpful, usually 4+ pages worth of questions to answer each time before class, and instructions are EXTREMELY confusing and often don't make sense.",4.0,3.0,"Jan 27th, 2020",854674
12299,Class was slightly lecture heavy but there were still plenty of examples and participation involved. The labs were good chances to get solid work done with direct feedback from her and a student aide. The assignments themselves were interesting to work through and transparent on requirements. Textbook is online and has questions associated.,4.0,4.0,"Nov 13th, 2019",854674
12300,"The class itself was extremely difficult and time consuming, but her expectations are clear from the beginning and she always made herself available in and out of office hours when I went to her for help. Her individual grades are based on a clear criteria. Even though I failed two skills tests, I got a B because of my homework and final project.",5.0,4.0,"May 10th, 2019",854674
12301,"Had this teacher for several classes 20 years ago. She has always been my favorite. She can be tough which is great for growth. Just make sure your in the course because you love the subject, and you'll find her to be a GREAT resource.",2.0,4.0,"Sep 12th, 2016",854674
12302,Lectures are unclear was well as lab instructions. Very difficult class. She is sassy and sarcastic at times and assumes you know more than you do considering this is an entrance class. Read the textbook and do outside study and you could pass the class.,5.0,5.0,"Apr 24th, 2015",854674
12303,"I took the course of mathematical foundation class during my master's in Western Kentucky University. I was the top grader in my class. I was the only one give A+ and another student was given A, the rest of the class was given B,C even D. She's a tough grader but if you put your efforts you'll get rewarded.",2.5,3.0,"Dec 29th, 2014",854674
12304,"Dr. Ziegler is extremely helpful, but she tends to be somewhat sassy. Her lab assignments are not always clear and she will take off for misunderstandings; ask if you have a question. In class, she frequently makes mistakes and her lectures are exceedingly boring. ",3.5,5.0,"Nov 11th, 2014",854674
12305,"Tough professor, but very very good at what she does. Expect to work. A lot. Very interesting material, and this is coming from someone who despises computer science. ",4.5,4.0,"Oct 8th, 2014",854674

12307,"If you are not interested in the computer science field, I would definitely not recommend Dr. Ziegler. She is very unreasonable in assigning homework and demands an unrealistic amount of dedication to one course. She does not teach all the material and expects stellar results. She has ruined any appreciation that I have had for computer science.",1.0,4.0,"Apr 27th, 2014",854674
12308,I attended one or more of Dr.  Ziegler courses approx. 19 years ago.  She was/is an excellent professor.  I highly recommend her.,4.5,5.0,"Jan 8th, 2014",854674
12309,"Dr. Ziegler is an amazing teacher--she explains things well and many times, she points out important connections between material, she is incredibly accessible and helpful, and she is ""on your level."" That's not to say that her classes are easy; they most certainly are not. But, read and do the labs, and ask for help, and a B is doable if ur smart.",4.5,4.0,"Dec 19th, 2013",854674
12310,"Dr. Ziegler will push you, but it'll be worth it. I learned a lot fast and well in her class. She's very helpful with any problem you might have - I emailed her about at problem at 10:30 p.m., and she got back to me in 30 minutes. She's also very flexible about deadlines and understanding of any problems. My favorite professor this semester!",3.5,4.0,"Jun 18th, 2012",854674

12314,"I caught him outside his office hours wanting help with a homework assignment and he made the time. He also is very lenient on late assignments as long as you speak to him. I would say as long as you attend class and take notes, his lectures aren't bad at all, you could receive an A.",5.0,3.0,"Apr 26th, 2018",1249640
12315,Dr. Zimmer is extremely intelligent and gives fantastic examples for real world application. He is always prepared for class and knows the material. He also has a really dry sense of humor and will hit you with a joke every now and then. The only downfall is that there aren't a lot of assignments in this course.

12318,"your whole grade comes from 3 tests. however he is a great teacher. very clear during lecture. his tests are pretty similar to the homework. as long as you understand the homework you will do well on the tests. he has homework review days. you also get out of class early alot, he gets to the point and lets you leave. he is GREAT.",5.0,3.0,"Oct 24th, 2017",1249640
12319,"I really enjoyed Professor Zimmer's class. It is primarily lecture based, but it is hard to teach math a different way. You have three tests for 90% of your grade and six homework assignments for the other 10%. If he sees you improve on your test/homework scores, he will work with you on your final grade. Overall, he is a really good professor.",5.0,2.0,"Dec 9th, 2016",1249640

12322,Dr. Zimmer is AWESOME!! He has a dry sence of humor that makes class more interesting. His notes are straight forward and are easy to follow.

12323,Loved Zimmer. He was very helpful just go to his office hours. Classes were always cut short. Only 3 tests and 6 homework assignments all semester.

12324,He is fantastic. He knows his stuff and can teach it well. There are only 3 tests and a few homework assignments so it is very important that you understand the material well in order to get a good grade.

12327,"Really nice guy, if somewhat dry and reserved.  I wish he'd be more interactive with the class, it might help with some concepts.  Easy to talk to, great for extra help if you need it, his office is always open to you.  Tries his best to prep the class for tests.  Specifically got him for a class next semester because he's such a nice guy.",2.0,3.0,"Sep 15th, 2011",1249640
12328,He is very boring makes me fall asleep every class period. He has no excitement in the class. It is very dead and boring. If you drink red bull or something you must drink it before his class.

I think that while there is a TON of reading, it is manageable and if I had put forth more effort, I would have gotten an A. I am thankful for Dr. Zubel as a professor, but she is a tough grader.
