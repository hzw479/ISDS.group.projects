0,"Nothing wrong with Dr. Abrams.  He didn't blow me away, but he is certainly good at what he does.  I took Business Law from him.  This was a challenging class, but it was not overly difficult.  If you work fairly hard, you should be able to get an A or B.",3.0,4.0,"May 8th, 2015",1585949
1,Prof Abrams took an interest in the students and took the time to get to know us as much as he could. He taught business law and he is a lawyer so he definitely knew the material and how to apply it to real life. I liked this class.,5.0,3.0,"Dec 27th, 2013",1585949
2,"I took this as an 8 week  online course, the professor never communicated with students or reminded us of deadlines. Took a very long time to grade assignments and didn't offer feedback on what to improve, didn't return emails or phone calls. He was useless. Avoid him if you can!",1.5,4.0,"Dec 9th, 2012",1585949

5,"Had him for business law. Not much feedback and falls 2 or 3 weeks behind on grading, but is an easy grader. As long as your formatting is on point and you sound like you know what you're taking about, you'll do fine. Make sure you read the textbook so you know the terminology.",5.0,2.0,"Oct 14th, 2017",2286648

7,"Professor Ackerman is a genuine and helpful professor. I don't recommend taking him in the morning for a Bible class because he was often very monotone during lectures and would be difficult to focus.

10,"Professor Ackerman is great! He is hilarious, knowledgable, and passionate about the subject. He responds to emails the same day (with the exception of Sunday), clear grading criteria, and always willing to help as long as you're willing to put in the work. In a hybrid class, group assignments were a part of class each week. Highly recommend!",5.0,2.0,"Dec 9th, 2016",2158472
11,"Ackerman is a funny professor, and his lectures are pretty interesting. He does tend to go through the slides quite fast, but his quizzes are easy and he always sends the powerpoints over email.

15,Dr. Agyapong is an amazing professor whose concern for his students reaches beyond the course content.

17,"I would recommend doing the practice problems in the textbooks. He allows you to make a cheat sheet - 8x11, as much information as you can cram onto it - for each exam. If you get work done on your project early, it's worth it to send it to him for his feedback before the deadline. He cares deeply about his students' success.",5.0,4.0,"Dec 19th, 2019",2189129
18,"Dr. Agyapong leads a very difficult class, but he wants you to succeed. He is more than willing to spend extra time one on one to make sure you understand. He provides great examples to follow. He has a heavy accent, but don't be worried. Make sure you attend all of his lectures so you get used to it. You can get an A in this class.",5.0,5.0,"Dec 6th, 2018",2189129
19,He is an asset to any serious institution of higher learning. An outstanding professor that commands his discipline well with scholarly fortitude.

Take his classes and grow!,2.0,5.0,"Oct 17th, 2017",2189129
20,"Choose another prof for GOV 603 course. I, along with other students, dropped the course. The concepts were difficult for me to grasp. Instructions and expectations were not clear. I was not following the course although I made efforts to stay on track. He expects too much and his lessons and grading styles are complex.",3.0,3.0,"Mar 16th, 2017",2189129

27,"A theology professor that is not very well versed in theology. This professor is very dense and has difficulty understanding concepts, he has a very mechanical knowledge which leads to frustration and communication difficulties. In my 70+ hours of graduate level study in theology, this professor is the least talented I have ever had.",2.0,4.0,"Jun 26th, 2019",2502997
28,CMHC 595 - Dr. Arveson is very available and responsive to students.  Her constructive feedback is very helpful.  She helped us move from students to professional counselors.,5.0,2.0,"Aug 25th, 2012",488205

30,Great Class. Dr. Arveson provided great feedback for the case studies to use when submitting future case studies. Only con - during class she allowed the questions to get out of hand. Meaning many of them should have been personal email communications instead of taking up class time and running past the class length.,4.0,3.0,"May 16th, 2018",2378289
31,This prof was very challenging but in a good way. She was realistic with her expectations and provided assistance as needed. I had a rough semester due to my full-time job but she was very pastoral yet professional in her approach. This was the most informative religion course I've taken in my college experience.,5.0,4.0,"Apr 8th, 2014",1500841
32,Dr. A is tough and thankfully demands one to earn their grade.  She is most helpful and provides timely constructive criticism that is aimed towards student growth.  I never earned greater than a B from Dr. A. and I am quite fine with that. I am a better student for sitting in her classroom.  She is as helpful as she is hard.,4.5,4.0,"Feb 23rd, 2013",1500841
33,"In my years at Regent, I have never received lower than an A+. I barely made a B- with her. She grades with zero mercy and is extremely unhelpful when I asked for ways to improve my grade. For a 111 class, she teaches a doctorate level course. Her bad grades were completely unfounded and she spoke way over the students heads. DON'T take her.",1.5,5.0,"Nov 12th, 2012",1500841
34,"I have three B's in all of my years of study, and one was in her class.  Extremely time consuming, but worth it.  Don't take her class if you're not a religion major.",5.0,5.0,"Apr 19th, 2012",1500841
35,If you can I highly recommend not taking any of her classes. Her late policy is very strict and she sticks to it like super glue. She has no compassion for student personal issues like Internet issues or sickness. If you miss an assignment due to sickness it's a flat zero. She dislikes working with you showing she doesn't care for your academics.,1.0,5.0,"Dec 8th, 2011",1500841
36,This professor is extremely uncaring. She is strict to her late policy even when you give a ligitamite reason. Absolutely no grace is her tone. I stand with the other students who say don't take her. The work is tedious and a lot. If you miss an assignment you lose out and get a big fat zero. She will make you cry!,1.5,5.0,"Dec 8th, 2011",1500841

38,"Part of your class/participation grade in order to get full credit for that day, requires you speak up in class, every class. This became VERY awkward and uncomfortable, especially when religion/theology isn't even your major. The textbook, THE UNIVERSE NEXTDOOR, is a TERRIBLE read. don't take her if you don't have to.",2.5,5.0,"Nov 23rd, 2011",1500841
39,"Extremely condescending. Not helpful in the slightest. Rarely, if ever, gives A's on anything. Never lets you make up quizzes (of which there are many) no matter what the occasion. Gives unclear instructions on projects, papers, etc. I highly recommend NOT taking her course.",2.0,4.0,"Sep 22nd, 2011",1500841

41,"Dr. Ayee is a nice professor, and I think she would do better teaching higher level courses. She is very stern and can be sarcastic at times.
