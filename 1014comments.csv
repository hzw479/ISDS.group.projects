Choose a different class, and different professor.",2.0,3.0,"Nov 10th, 2019",1995922

Clicker questions is where you need to show up, there are alot.",5.0,3.0,"Dec 8th, 2016",850234
58,"TA Duncan's lab was very easy. It's basically relearning what you already have in biology lecture.

62,This class was the hardest class I have had at TWU. It is very fast paced.  The TA taught the class and I only saw the professor the very first class.  The TA had a very thick accent and was so hard to understand!  You had to copy the overhead and half the time the TA would change slides before everyone had copied it. Quizzes every week but one.,2.0,3.0,"Dec 9th, 2013",850234
