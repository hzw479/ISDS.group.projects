1,"Abbott is by far the worst professor I have had at UChicago. For some reason he decided to play mind games with me throughout the quarter. His feedback on our weekly essays was not helpful. He even targeted me personally, saying that I lacked intellectual curiosity or was deeply depressed in his written feedback.",1.0,4.0,"Jun 10th, 2021",1153787
2,He is the best of the best in his field. I had a great experience taking his class.,5.0,3.0,"May 24th, 2018",1153787
3,"AA is the kind of UChi Prof one either loves or hates. Contrary to many reviews here, he actually cares a lot about students, tries to get everyone involved, and assign reasonable amount of reading. His style of teaching Power actually allows people to have  the big picture of what is going on , which many young profs here are unable to deliver.",5.0,1.0,"Jul 2nd, 2014",1153787
4,I learned an incredible amount in his class. Extremely intelligent and on top of the field. He could communicate course expectations a little better though.,3.5,4.0,"Aug 19th, 2012",1153787
5,"all in all, tries to be nice, but is not really.  i think that working as an orderly impacted him.  a great deal of sensitivity in someone so sentimental.  danger!  grades very hard.  only favors 1 or 2 kissups in the class.  gossips favorably for a person in his social existence.",1.0,5.0,"Nov 16th, 2011",1153787
6,This professor can hold your attention. He is a fair grader however the stress associated with not knowing how youre doing in class sucks. He's nice and knows a lot about the field. Id never take a class with him again though,1.0,4.0,"Mar 23rd, 2009",1153787
7,Great at leading and encouraging debate. A little arrogant and out of touch though. Be prepared to do more work than what should be expected for this type of class. We had four papers a midterm and a final,2.5,5.0,"Nov 13th, 2008",1153787
8,"Could have been a great class but a lot of people were underprepared.  A lot of the books were mediocre and the work of extremely minor sociologists.  Some good stories though.  I enjoyed a good share of sociology department gossip.  Yes, sociologists actually gossip too.  We talked about cher and her hair styles all the time. :)  Really..",3.0,5.0,"Jul 11th, 2008",1153787

10,The most energy I have ever seen a professor put into teaching in my 4 years at the university. Very accessible.,5.0,5.0,"Jan 31st, 2014",165523
11,He's an extremely helpful and approachable professor.  The material isn't always easy but you won;t have too hard of a time if you visit him during office hours.  I would say he's not as difficult as people say he is.  You just need to ask for a lot of help which some people aren't comfortable doing.,5.0,2.0,"Apr 27th, 2012",165523
12,too old to be teaching. teaches regular physics at an honors level. This is not helpful for people that aren't really really good at physics,2.0,5.0,"Sep 8th, 2011",165523
13,"Prof. Abella teaches a very rewarding E&M course. He presents advanced mathematical framework in E&M whenever possible. He also holds his students to very high standards on homework, attendance, and participation (a very good thing).",4.5,4.0,"Sep 17th, 2007",165523
14,"Isaac Abella is nothing short of an extraordinary teacher.  His lectures are clear, explaining the material in an organized manner that leads from one topic to another with a fair amount of fluidity.  I took his Honors E&M class(142) and while the problems were very difficult, they were certainly fair and we were well-prepared.",5.0,4.0,"Sep 1st, 2007",165523
15,"Dr. Abella was THE BEST professor I had in college. Not only did he love the material he taught, he was a socially conscious man who cared deeply about helping undergrads understand their place in both academics and society at large. I miss my talks with Dr. Abella and I hope he is still doing the same for other young students.",4.5,4.0,"Jun 22nd, 2007",165523
16,I had him for my Freshman Physics class back in 1984 and he is the one who got me interested in becoming a physics major.  I loved his enthusiasm and teaching style.  I ended up getting my PhD in Physics because I had such a good experience.,5.0,3.0,"Nov 15th, 2006",165523
17,"I went to his office hours and found him very helpful, even though I was over my head in his course.  His course was difficult, but he did his best to make everything clear.  He strikes me as a man with a conscience, someone who cares about students and about making a positive impact on the world through his teaching.  Fine, but still, I got a C!",5.0,4.0,"Apr 22nd, 2006",165523

38,"Hussein is the best self, culture, and society teacher out there. his class is super unstressful grade-wise, but he challenges to really learn the material by calling out bs in class and making you read and write to the best of your ability. If you wanna not worry bout grades too much but wanna really learn something, then take his class.",5.0,4.0,"Feb 24th, 2015",1126375
39,"Hussein is literally a god. His class is tailored not be stressful, but he really engages the class well. Many other Core professors are just fine with you saying dumb stuff you barely remember after skimming the 10-50 pages out of your 200 page reading assignment, but Hussein isn't afraid to ask the hard questions.",5.0,1.0,"Sep 6th, 2014",1126375

58,"I am accustomed to profs who do not understand how important it is for students to learn how to think about social issues, rather than regurgitating a prof's personal opinions to advance their own research.Its time for profs to look beyond themselves and consider that maybe their research is not more important than their responsibility to students.",2.0,4.0,"Jul 19th, 2012",1548065
59,"These comments are way too hard on Scott Allard. Scott is really knowledgeable and friendly, and does not seem close minded. He is a very hard grader, but he also takes a lot of time to meet with students outside of class. He isn't a social worker, but about a third of SSA faculty aren't either.",5.0,5.0,"May 30th, 2012",1548065
60,"Dr. Allard is extremely knowledgeable, easy to communicate with, and open to further assistance outside of class. He is a tough grader but if you work hard you will do well. I would definitely take a class with him again. Don't miss him, one of the best professors at SSA. ",5.0,3.0,"Feb 19th, 2012",1548065
61,"Professor Allard is uncomfortable with concepts outside his own experience and research, and therefore intolerant and disinterested in new or challenging approaches to social policy. Researchers who often also teach, must resist the urge to indoctrinate students or at least be more tolerant, even though it may be contrary to their own work.",1.5,2.0,"Dec 28th, 2011",1548065
62,He was way picky on the paper - silly reasons why he would give students not so great grades - and I got one of the better grades!  I never really understood why he is teaching here - he has a PhD in political science - clearly nothing related to social service/social work.  On the positive side - I did learn something - the book Street Burecrat,2.5,4.0,"Mar 10th, 2011",1548065
63,Professor Amit tried at times to present the material well but often failed as probability theory was not his area of expertise. He also had a rude and sarcastic manner to him and once refused to answer someone's question on generating functions in class. His exams were hard and he relied on the TA to help the students.,2.0,4.0,"Sep 21st, 2020",2168135
64,Professor Amit was not a bad lecturer though probability theory was not his strongest suit. He was very rude to the students and once refused to answer a girl's question on generating functions because he thought it was stupid.

65,"Professor Ando is great. He's very open to new ideas and once the student makes the effort to reach out, he is usually available for a chat. I was a complete rookie to ancient Roman empire history, so I had lots of questions when I was taking his grad-level class. But he was very helpful and sent me articles when he thought I might like them.",5.0,2.0,"Oct 13th, 2017",907446

I spent way too much time on the Fall of the Roman Empire. .Smart guy  about the ancien Rome, so? Not recommended. ",2.5,3.0,"Jun 22nd, 2015",907446
67,I don't know if this was a course in classics or political indoctrination. Ando was trying to brainwash the students on his liberal political leanings constantly. I was afraid to disagree with him fearful of getting a bad grade. This class was bull and should have gone to the dean to file a complaint refunded. .
