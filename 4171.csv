I found Dr. Azghaniâ??s lectures difficult to understand, not because of his accent, but because his lectures do not flow in a comprehensible way.  It is difficult without seeing a lecture to explain why they are such a train wreck but I will have read the chapter prior to lecture and walk out of lecture scratching my head saying to myself, â??What the heck was that?!â??  Dr. Azghani  posts lecture slides on Blackboard, however, much of the time they are Ms. Pundtâ??s (another professor  in the UTT biology department)  so the slides are useless for note taking in class since he uses his own slides to lecture from and one cannot follow along with Ms. Pundtâ??s slides since they are in a different order.  When asked to post all of his slides to blackboard his answer was that they contain all the same information and continued to post Ms. Pundtâ??s slides and lecture from his own.  Frustrating!  Dr. Azghani starts every class asking for questions.  Most of the time the class doesnâ??t have much to say and he will proceed to chastise the class for not having questions since he feels that this is the way to learn.  To appease him I decided to jot down questions that came up in my reading and start asking them at the beginning of class when he asked.   Nine times out of ten I never got a direct answer to my question.  Much of the time heâ??d say weâ??ll get to that in lecture, other times heâ??d mumble around and give some nonsense answer that left you more confused then you were prior to asking the question.  I found myself frustrated and quite angry that I was paying a lot of money to be in class with an â??expertâ?? and got virtually nothing out of the lectures.   His tests are 50 questions each, multiple choice.  Good luck, he will not in any way narrow down the focus to help you study for the exams.  I DO NOT expect to be spoon fed the questions to the exam, but there is such a volume of material in each and every chapter and the concepts are very complex that it would be nice to have an idea that heâ??s very interested in knowing that you know this concept down to the gnatâ??s rear end level of detail but you could be more broad brush on this concept.  There were times when he asked questions on the exam that were not in the book and he did not lecture on them.  When I went to his office to bring this to his attention he seemed a little put off to have to admit that this was the case.  Do not take this class if you are expecting to learn from the lecture.  The only value to the lecture are the bonus points you get for attending on the exam grades.   Most individuals do very poorly on the exams and the bonus points are the only thing that allow many students to achieve a passing grade.  The book is excellent if you are a self-starter; you can read and teach yourself using the book and the Wiley plus resources online.  I would not take Dr. Azghani again for anything-EVER!

She fully immerses us from day 1 and mostly taught with little to no English translations. She is not consistent in what she tells you to study for and what she actually tests over. Overall, poor teacher and waste of time!', 'MUY MAL!! This teacher is unorganized and scatter brained and I learned nothing more that what I knew going in. If you want to learn spanish, take utley.If you want an easy grade, take Zuazu. Very nice lady but not an effective teacher.', 'very sweet disposition -- very willing to help stufdents out. a little disorganized adn i feel as though i could have been taught more than what i was. her tests were easy and what work she did make you turn in was also very easy.', ""This professor is very helpful, wants her students to do well, returned assignments in a timely manner, gave good test reviews, and provided a variety of ways to practice the French language, including in class discussion, so that you're more likely to learn.  I highly recommend her."", 'This professor just rox.  She is in possession of a wonderful sense of humor and fully endorses the creativity of her students.  To bolster the dry mechanics she adds a taste of literature and poetry.  I especially recommend this professor for any non-spanish major. Very relaxed and easy going!']","['Caring', 'Tough grader', 'Get ready to read', 'Participation matters', 'Gives good feedback', 'Get ready to read', 'SO MANY PAPERS', 'Caring', 'Get ready to read', 'Participation matters', 'GRADED BY FEW THINGS', 'Participation matters']"
