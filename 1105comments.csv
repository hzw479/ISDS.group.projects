Get on his level and hurl insults right back at him and he'll like you forever. Rob was so cool I might actually take his class just for fun.",5.0,4.0,"Oct 5th, 2017",531711
1,"Rob is SO much fun! DRAM280 is a fast-paced class because you go through carpentry, light/sound design, stage rigging, electrics, etc. in the course of one semester, so attendance is crucial to keep up, plus you have to assist as run crew in school theater/music/dance productions. Learning all the behind the scenes stuff was so valuable!",5.0,3.0,"Jul 18th, 2016",531711
2,"Rob is an awesome teacher! He is super funny and definitely tries to keep the class alive and having fun. His exams are a little hard. Watts/Volts/Amps on every exam.

10,"Gotta love Rob. He's a great guy.  Watch out though, if you don't understand his humor you're likely to get hurt feelings. But I can tell you with 100% certainty that he doesn't mean it that way. He's a real sweetie at heart and would never intentionally hurt someone's feelings. He's just sarcastic.",4.5,3.0,"Apr 14th, 2005",531711

I didn't give him the score I gave him because of that though, because he actually was a pretty good teacher. I'm giving him that score because he's pretty condescending and arrogant.",3.0,3.0,"Dec 13th, 2017",132609
43,"Took precalculus over the summer and struggled quite a bit. His teaching style was confusing for me at first, but as I studied my notes after class it started to make a lot more sense. He also gave us a group project which was figuring out the exact location of a ride in a theme park using lots of math. I strongly recommend this professor.",5.0,4.0,"Sep 20th, 2016",132609
44,"Anderson has a unique teaching style. Usually there are a LOT of math professors that would go by the book however, Anderson is able to eliminate all the details and have students see the bigger picture.

45,MATH140XMATH104  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PROFESSOR. Kind & caring. Demonstrates passion for what he teaches. Will call you out to answer questions. Very patient.

47,The teacher is very conceptual and makes you work hard for a good grade. DO NOT buy the book because he creates all of his own homework and group projects. VISIT THE TUTORS because that is the only way to do well in the class. ,3.5,4.0,"Jan 8th, 2015",132609
48,I'm surprised at how positive these reviews. Anderson is awful. He is condescending to those who do not understand the material.  He has actually laughed at someone who asked a simple question. He does not seem to understand that some people have trouble with math. Most students were only passing because they constantly got help from tutors. ,1.5,4.0,"Dec 17th, 2014",132609
49,"Great teacher! He is definitely more conceptual about topics, and overall gives you a better understanding of math as a whole. I like how he doesn't focus on minute details, but rather giving us a solid foundation of calculus. He creates all of his assignments, tests, and homework. He helps you, so much as you need without feeding you the answers. ",3.5,4.0,"Nov 18th, 2014",132609

59,I took the summer session Calculus II course. It was phenomenal. I LOVED this teacher. If I could take this class again I would.

60,"Great professor over all. He taught us to do problems conceptually with an open mind, rather than just memorizing mindless facts. He rarely uses the textbook because he makes up his own problems. In fact, he despises the book and the way it teaches the subject. His group projects are tough, but interesting. He has some funny stories too! Take Mitch",5.0,3.0,"Jul 21st, 2011",132609

3672,I'm not sure what is wrong with the guy below who took stats. It was easy. Yudko shows you step by step how to do the homework problems in his videos. His videos are easy to follow. There are quizzes right out of the text. And there's a paper. Half the class got A's.,4.0,4.0,"Aug 13th, 2018",691079
3673,Probably the best professor in the department. Knows his stuff. Will go out of his way to help. He actually came in on a Saturday before an exam for a study session.,5.0,5.0,"Aug 8th, 2018",691079
3674,"He grades you only for 3 exams & they are all writing essays. They were extremely hard. I say to just read the book, go to class especially review days & practice writing the essays. Wouldnt wanna take him again.",1.0,5.0,"Feb 23rd, 2018",691079
3675,"If you want to get a good grade in this class, you have to attend class regularly. Make sure you buy the book & get ready to do a lot of reading. This class only consists of 3 exams for your overall grade, so you need to really study. Its a very hard class & Wouldnt recommend taking his class & Didnt like the way he teaches.",1.0,5.0,"Feb 15th, 2018",691079
3676,"Not a good online professor, it is really hard to understand his class. All he does is take videos of his screen and talk but the quality of the videos are so poor I cannot even read the numbers. It would be a lot easier if he had transcripts of his lectures so that you could follow along and try to piece together what he is saying.",2.0,4.0,"Apr 11th, 2017",691079
3677,"Yudko is a fantastic professor. I have taken him for biopsychology as well as this course. Material is really difficult so I would recommend coming to class. Only two exams count for entire grade, both essay based. He gives you the essays 2 weeks in advance so you can include all the important information. Smartest man I know. Would take again. :)",4.5,4.0,"Dec 13th, 2014",691079
3678,"Yudko is the real MVP. Going to class and participating in class discussions will help a lot, but he doesn't grade on attendance. Three multiple choice exams for the semester determine your final grade, so if you're into that kinda thing, Yudko is your guy.",3.5,3.0,"Dec 3rd, 2014",691079
3679,"Excellent professor, didn't like him the first few classes- but he is a genius! Truly dedicated to students and genuinely interested in subjects he teaches. Have taken Biopsych and Emotionality, both classes were challenging but rewarding!",4.5,4.0,"Dec 12th, 2011",691079

3683,"emotion bio psych and some directed studies Yudko is approachable, extreemly intelligent, & eager to help. NOT creepy and I have never heard of him coming onto anyone including myself. He is eager to motivate and teach and if ur self absorbed u maybe took it wrong. He simply loves his field and wants his students to learn. I would highly recommend.",5.0,5.0,"Aug 3rd, 2010",691079
3684,Yudko is a quality teacher.  His classes are difficult and you really have to study diligently for your grade.  He will help when asked. He is friendly- to each sex- when approached and tries his hardest to help. Taking his class is loads of work but worth the resulting education.,3.5,5.0,"Jul 9th, 2010",691079
3685,No textbooks required for this class. Professor makes it clear that everyone attends all her lectures to understand the material and pass with an A. Tons of quizzes and exams but she does this so students walk away with a better understanding of the material.,4.5,1.0,"Nov 29th, 2011",1056676

3689,"After taking this class I realized that philosophy is definitely not my thing. Although the professor gives great feedback, I felt that it was a chore to get online and listen to each video about a topic that did not interest me. I learned that philosophy is mainly about questioning everything and anything, and anyone can be a philosopher.",5.0,3.0,"Nov 19th, 2019",2256733

Also, he NEVER updated his grade book.. So I didnt know what my grade was in his class until the end of the semester..",,,,2306516
