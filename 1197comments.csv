0,he knows what hes talking about and will work with you on anything you ask about.,5.0,1.0,"Nov 30th, 2012",145395
1,I learned almost nothing from his class. He lets movies do his teaching and his stories are irrelevant and only told to make himself look good. He does not check homework assignments or offer any feedback only looks to see if they are completed. He is not helpful at all and blows off student's questions.,2.0,1.0,"Aug 26th, 2012",145395
2,"Dr. Aagaard is an awesome guy. He is energetic and you can tell that he loves teaching. Everything is done through e-mail so stay on top of it, but you only really need the book to make your quizzes. He is pretty helpful, but he is a little high on himself. If you can get though his stories about all the things he has experience, you will do fine",5.0,2.0,"May 2nd, 2012",145395
3,"This class was very easy, but Aagaard is very disrespectful. Slow response on assignments, patronizes his students, and clealy finds himslf to be God's gift to teaching. Calls out students for little mistakes infront of whole class and calls the class his 'naive students.' Every story he tells relates back to what a great teacher and person he is.",3.5,1.0,"Dec 10th, 2011",145395
4,"I was reading some trivia on ""dead poety society"" and thought of Dr. Aagaard.  Dr. Aagaard stood on his desk before Mr. Keating did and I always wondered if Dr. Aagaard was affiliated with ""dps"".  Thanks Dr. Aagaard your a great professor.",5.0,2.0,"Dec 7th, 2011",145395
5,Dr. Aagard is a fun teacher and is eager to offer help. CI 541 is a very easy class and I learned a few things here and there in each program explored.,5.0,1.0,"Aug 16th, 2011",145395

8,"Great teacher he was so helpful. It was based on e-mailing in all of your assignments, so stay on top of it!",4.5,3.0,"Apr 13th, 2010",145395
9,"I thought overall Dr. Aagaard was a pretty excellent professor.  You could tell her cared deeply about education and informing us about teaching.  I did get annoyed that he seemed to have a story for everything, ie:  had been shot at, knew about the ""gangstas"", etc...That's about the only thing that annoyed me. Other than that, great guy.",5.0,1.0,"Mar 21st, 2010",145395
10,with-it and very realiztic as he prepared me for the real job/world,5.0,4.0,"Feb 8th, 2010",145395
11,"Very nice. I recommend him. Grade depends on attendance and doing homework plus 2 group presentations. He?s a very friendly, touchy-feely person (not in an inappropriate way) and so might put his hand on your shoulder or stand close to talk to you",5.0,2.0,"Aug 21st, 2009",145395
12,DO your homework right away!,3.5,1.0,"May 18th, 2009",145395

18,He was great. He cares about how you are and keeps the assignments low. We watched great movies and had fun discussion. He loves his job and you can tell. He is the best teacher I have had here at WSU. He gives you a sheet to let you know what grade you have every 2 weeks. He is just great!,5.0,1.0,"May 14th, 2007",145395
19,VERY disorganized! goes off on tangents... talks too much during videos.  he does care a great deal about his students.,3.0,2.0,"Jun 4th, 2006",145395
20,"She is an incredible teacher, and very knowledgeable. I have learned more in one semester with her than in 4.5 years of Spanish prior. I would highly recommend her.",5.0,3.0,"Dec 9th, 2017",1242074
21,"Extremely knowledgeable about Spanish. I thoroughly enjoyed coming to her class, and I can say with certainty that I learned SO much just in one semester. She loves to laugh and make her students laugh as well. Wonderful class overall, would definitely recommend Abbott to anyone learning Spanish!",5.0,3.0,"Dec 19th, 2016",1242074
22,"Probably the best teacher at this school. She's intimidating, but very good at what she's does and actually really nice.",5.0,4.0,"Nov 29th, 2016",1242074
23,"Class moves along quickly and there's a lot of homework, but that's how you learn. She gives partial credit so if you only get part of something correct, she'll give you a half point. Attendance and participation are key to passing. She comes off as abrasive at first but is actually very nice. ",5.0,4.0,"May 5th, 2015",1242074
24,"Honestly  fun teacher, great attitude and loves to teach.  However, this class had a lot of homework and was a lot of work in general.  Busted my butt to keep up, homework, participation and attendance are key to be successful if your not a natural.",5.0,5.0,"Dec 14th, 2014",1242074
25,"This teacher is nice, really knows her stuff.  However, there is a ton of homework, lots of tests and if your late or miss you will get penalized.  Tough class, she definitely makes you work for your grade.  If you student load is big, you might want to take this class with a smaller load because of homework load.  She is great at giving you help.",5.0,4.0,"Dec 12th, 2014",1242074
26,"Ms. Abbott is a fantastic teacher who likes to try to make class fun.  Be aware that she will dock points if you are late or absent.  There is a lot of online homework, but it's all pretty easy and the homework really helps you practice Spanish.  There are a lot of tests, but they are easy if you do the homework.  Her class is not for slackers.",4.5,3.0,"Dec 9th, 2014",1242074
27,"She is a great teacher!! She is very helpful and is always willing to answer any questions. She is strict, do not use cell phones, don't be late and you need to go to class, or you will be lost and fail the tests. It is not an easy class and there is alot of homework, but she is a great teacher and really energetic and funny!",4.5,4.0,"May 8th, 2014",1242074
28,She was a very active teacher but she didnt teach me anything. She thinks you need to teach yourself and ask her questions which was not a good learning method for me. I felt like I could not as questions because she looked at me like I was stupid and gave me a short answer.,2.0,4.0,"May 6th, 2014",1242074
29,"Very friendly and willing to work with students. She is fun and upbeat in class. She explains things well and wants you to understand. The grades were based on quizzes, homework, tests, and participation. Loved this course",5.0,3.0,"Mar 24th, 2014",1242074
30,great,4.5,3.0,"Feb 25th, 2014",1242074
31,Excellent instructor. She wants you to succeed. Brings in literature and current events.  Has to cover too much material but manages to do it with humor and good attitude. Recommended without reservation.,4.5,3.0,"Dec 30th, 2013",1242074
32,Very fun and energetic teacher! A LOT of homework!! Be prepared to spend a LOT of time studying and doing the online homework!,4.5,2.0,"Jun 24th, 2013",1242074
33,"She is energetic and fun, but forces you to rely too much on other students as well as moves too fast and gets frustrated when people get stuck.  She was very intense about staying on schedule, which makes me think there is a problem with the course, which also doesn't allow people any way to understand grammar principles without her.",3.5,3.0,"Jan 8th, 2013",1242074
34,"She is AMAZING. If you are needing help go schedule a time to see her and she will help you out. If you need a tutor, you can pay her but she's better than most. If you starting out in Spanish she's awesome to take.",4.5,3.0,"Sep 18th, 2012",1242074
35,"I recommend her. She was always very cheerful about teaching and helpful in making sure you understand. Answers all questions. Come to class, do hw, and study; you will be fine.",3.5,4.0,"Apr 12th, 2012",1242074
36,She was a great teacher! Learned alot in her clase!,4.5,3.0,"Nov 6th, 2011",1242074
37,"Senorita Abbott was so fun! She was extremely excited about teaching us Spanish everyday and answered all our questions, even if they were on the inappropriate side. I would definitely recommend her. Her sarcasm was refreshing and appropriate!",4.5,2.0,"Nov 30th, 2010",1242074
38,Srta. Abbott is AWESOME!! She's always super excited about class and makes spanish fun. As long as you keep up with whats going on in class and on quia the class is pretty easy. Would most definitely recommend her!! :),5.0,2.0,"May 19th, 2009",1242074

41,"Expect to work hard every week, and lots of homework. Great professor, punctual, teaches in an entertaining way, and very helpful with questions.",4.5,4.0,"Apr 24th, 2016",2131650
42,"Very low quality course from a very low quality professor. Very disorganized and is terrible at communicating or teaching anything. This professor also does not understand how rounding works at all, which is extraordinarily frustrating and makes homework a gamble of figuring out how the professor arbitrarily decided to round certain numbers.",1.0,3.0,"Apr 21st, 2021",145397
43,"This class is the most difficult one Ive ever taken. Disclaimer: In no way shape or form am I blaming this course or professor for the outcome, it is my full responsibility for the grade I have received. This professor gives no second chances or grace. Content is posted in clutters with no guidance. Contact her and directs you to tutor.",2.0,5.0,"Dec 10th, 2019",145397
44,"Hard to understand her english which makes it really hard since she fails to explain things. Homework and Quizzes are easy, but the test are multiple choice and tricky.",2.0,4.0,"Nov 10th, 2018",145397
45,I heard nightmare stories about DS350 so I came into this 8-week course with the worst in mind. I ended up with an A. Sue structures her online lectures concisely but enough to show you how processes work and how to come to your answers. She also shows you the shortcuts for processes and makes things so much simpler than the book does.,4.0,4.0,"Aug 17th, 2018",145397
46,"I took the course online in the summer & it was pretty tough due to being provided heavy material for a 4-week session. You'll just have to be up to date with reading and assignments in order to pass her course. She does, however, provided voiced over PDFs to clear up any confusion of materials. Be sure to go over those as well.",4.0,4.0,"Nov 28th, 2017",145397
47,I think the material can be a little hard to understand for the concepts you have to read the actual book to get. Learn the formulas and what variables are used and you will be fine for the exam. Listen to her voiceover pdfs!,4.0,4.0,"Jul 31st, 2017",145397
48,"The DS350 course was easier than I expected. I took it online as a 4-week summer course. There were relatively easy assignments and quizzes that were open book/internet. The tests are proctored on campus and closed book/internet, but they are 100% calculations, so study the practice problems and you'll ace the exams. Use Excel when possible.",4.0,2.0,"Jun 28th, 2017",145397
49,"This is a very tough class in general. I don't blame my instructor for my grade, I think it is just tough material. I THINK i am going to barely pass this class with a D-. I would recommend getting it over in a 4 week summer class. Dr. Sue did a FANTASTIC job communicating to us, even though it is an online class.",3.0,5.0,"Jun 22nd, 2017",145397
50,"Overall this was an okay class.  I took it as a summer pre-session.  Quizzes are conceptual only, and tests are computational only. There's one discussion board post that's pretty easy. She gave extra credit.  Lots of math involved but gives a formula sheet for the exams.  Not as hard as I anticipated. Overall she's a good professor.",4.0,3.0,"Jun 20th, 2017",145397
51,Took class as a 4 week intercession class during the summer. Was able to complete class while working 40 hour weeks with no problem. Would definitely recommend versus taking the semester long class.,4.0,3.0,"Jun 5th, 2017",145397
52,Dr. Sue is a perfect example of a professor spending too much time in academia. She is completely unaware of student demands/time and expects her course to take priority. The project was too time intensive for an 8 week course when combined with exams.,1.0,3.0,"Mar 17th, 2017",145397
53,She does not instruct. She give the examples from the book (which are not clearly labelled) and expects us to decipher her work and learn from it. Would not recommend this instructor.,1.0,4.0,"Mar 10th, 2017",145397
54,By far one of the worst professors I have ever had. She does not teach & often makes mathematical mistakes that she does not fix. Her quizzes often cover never before seen material & is very unclear with her questions. If you have to take DS350 I strongly advise you to take it with a different professor. I would give her a negative rating if able.,1.0,5.0,"Feb 28th, 2017",145397
55,"Professor is extremely helpful and clear in the courses description and objectives. Study the practice problems and memorize the formulas and you'll pass easily. Easy points, easy grading, definitely recommend this course and professor.",4.0,3.0,"Dec 26th, 2016",145397
56,I took this class in 4 weeks and I would NOT RECOMMEND IT. There is too much information for 4 weeks. Be sure to go to office hours. The book is necessary.,5.0,4.0,"Jul 1st, 2016",145397
57,"This is by far the most difficult class I have taken. I took it online as an 8-week class and it was brutal. So much material to learn in a short amount of time.  Have a 90-minute proctored exam every 2 weeks. Never once saw the professor, even at the exams. Course material is extremely difficult. Extremely difficult class. Would not recommend.",1.5,5.0,"Mar 17th, 2016",145397
58,"Definitely challenging and no doubt you have to put in your effort... Lots of prep. I took this course Fall Semester Oct-Dec '15 offered online. Her voice-over pdf's are crucial to studying. The rest is slides, documents, homework questions, etc. Quizzes online, Homework online, but I always took the Exams in Clinton Hall (they were proctored.) ",3.5,4.0,"Dec 11th, 2015",145397
59,Take the pre-session!!!!!! She is amazing and definitely helps students understand the material.,4.0,3.0,"Jan 23rd, 2015",145397
60,"Took as a pre-session. The class moves very fast. Put most your energy into studying the formulas because they will be on the test and accounts for 60% of the exam. The other 40% of the exam in open book and online. Grades went as follows, Exam 1 45% A's, 38% B's & 17% C's. Exam 2 38% A's, 33% B's & 29% C's. Class is 330 points (3 exams, 2 quizes)",4.0,4.0,"Jan 24th, 2014",145397
61,"I find the material in this class to be difficult but she tried to provide examples that would help us.  I don't really think this class works as an online class, but I didn't think the class was too terrible.",3.0,4.0,"Sep 4th, 2013",145397
62,She is very caring. I enjoyed her class. She is nice and will always make sure you're doing great. If you missed couple points don't worry. She will help you out. She is great!!,5.0,2.0,"Oct 20th, 2020",2345188
63,She is very caring. I enjoyed her class. She is nice and will always make sure you're doing great. If you missed couple points don't worry. She will help you out. She is great!!,5.0,3.0,"Jun 18th, 2019",2345188
64,"Class was centered around discussions and books pertaining to mental illness. Lots of readings and Blackboard discussions but they are easy to follow. There are also a couple writing assignments and tests. Miss A is enthusiastic, laidback, and open to feedback. She is very approachable and passionate about teaching, which made the class enjoyable.",,,,2345188
65,"Professor Abernathy is a great teacher. Her PPs are well organized and summarize the chapter of each book well, but the reading will still be necessary as she leaves a few terms out. There are a few easy papers as well as weekly quizzes with a mid-term and final test. This course is easy if you spend a few hours a week on it. Study for exams.",5.0,2.0,"Dec 14th, 2020",2455736

67,I definitely recommend this professor. She is very knowledgable on the subject and very caring of others. Attendance is mandatory for you will have to turn in a participation assignment every class. As long as you complete assignments and study for the tests you'll get an A or B for sure.,,,,2455736
68,One of the most kindest and caring professors I've had at WSU. Dr. Abi-Mikhael is willing to help you succeed and made the class very fun and enjoyable (lunches and coffee sessions to practice Arabic). Highly recommended!,5.0,3.0,"Nov 11th, 2017",1807950
69,"I had her for a summer course, and she catapulted my understanding of French amazingly well in such a short amount of time. She will take the time to get to know you, and she'll make little inside jokes throughout the semester to lighten the mood. She gives extra credit, and will try as to help you as much as you try to understand.",5.0,3.0,"Aug 22nd, 2017",1807950
70,"Mme Abi-Mikael is incredibly kind. If you work hard and attend collaborate sessions, take E.C. opportunities and ask questions, then she will work just as hard for you. I messed up on a quiz and got a 2.5/10 because I didn't read the instructions properly and she gave me partial credit-- 8.5/10.  Wants you to succeed. Cares about her students.",4.0,3.0,"Feb 6th, 2017",1807950
71,"Mme Abi-Mikael is so energetic and nice. She is sometimes a little hard to understand (she speaks better French than English) but you learn more when you're forced to use the language rather than falling back to English. If you are willing to put in the effort, she will go the extra mile to make sure you succeed.",3.5,4.0,"May 28th, 2013",1807950
72,Leigh is very understanding and willing to help you succeed in the course. She will let you go to other yoga classes if you can't make it to your assigned class. It was a very laid-back class.,4.5,1.0,"May 22nd, 2015",2018848
73,"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Barely understandable, multiple mistakes during the class, students often correct him. Exams are not clear at all and he even has to change them in order to be solved. Never prepares classes and pretty much improvises everyday. Avoid classes with this man.",1.0,5.0,"Oct 25th, 2012",145399
74,"His writing is small, he cant explain anything, and even when you go in for help during office hours he won't help you. He teaches like you already know the material, only doing random problems from the book in class, and he says he will put the easy stuff on the test but its the hardest problems out of the book modified with harder numbers.",1.0,5.0,"Oct 17th, 2012",145399
75,"Acker is really tough to understand and his writing on the board is something to be desired, but he does try really hard to help students succeed. He uses online assignments and if you do them and watch the videos, it really helps. He is not the best but he is definitely not the worst. He is on the disorganized side though",2.0,3.0,"May 2nd, 2012",145399
76,I needed a lot of help to understand the subject and Acker gave me all the help I needed. He was so patient with me that I'm forever grateful. I think he's wicked smart and willing to help anybody that shows they're willing to work.,5.0,3.0,"Apr 21st, 2012",145399
77,"Terrible teacher, dont waste your time and money taking his class. He has very small, terrible handwriting making it hard to take notes. He teaches methods for calc 3 that are not in the book which makes it very hard to do assignments. His homework is very long and is often due before we even start the section that it is over!",1.0,5.0,"Feb 10th, 2012",145399

79,"rediculous professor. I learned more from the online homework videos than I ever did in class. if you have a question youre better off asking other students because he can't explain anything. i will say the guy is insainly smart, he is just a terrible teacher. if you have a strong calc background you'll do fine bit for first timers I strongly recomend finding any other professor.",1.0,4.0,"Dec 1st, 2010",145399

81,"Dr. Acker takes a difficult subject and makes it clear, a dry subject and makes it interesting.  The man has total mastery of the field. Grading is fair and you will learn.

83,"Worst teacher of ANYTHING I've ever had, for many reasons. Claims no responsibility for losing student's work, makes tests too long and complicated to complete during class, is generally incomprehensible. 555 is a required course for MANY students at WSU, and the fact that he is one of few available to teach it is an insult to the paying students.",1.0,5.0,"Apr 26th, 2009",145399
84,Worst Math teacher i have ever had,2.0,4.0,"Apr 16th, 2009",145399
85,"Never ever consider taking a class with him! I had to drop after passing Calc 1-3 quite easily. He mumbles,stands in front of the board so you can't see his tiny writing and doesn't explain any of the methods he is using to solve. He will actually stop halfway through problems and erase because he can't do it. I'm ashamed of the University for him.",1.5,5.0,"Mar 31st, 2009",145399

88,I had to drop his class because he made no sense whatsoever.  He didn't answer a question and didn't teach - he didn't explain anything and you can hardly understand a word he says.  I wouldn't recommend his class to anyone needing Calculus to graduate.,1.0,5.0,"Oct 21st, 2005",145399

90,"Acker is a nice guy, however, he shouldn't be teaching.  He has got to be 80 or well into his 70s and he shakes.  He rambles, mumbles, writes small, does not explain concepts. His way of teaching is to write problems on the board and solve them in a manner that does not make sense.  Do not take this teacher if you want to keep your sanity.",1.0,5.0,"Sep 6th, 2005",145399

94,"Took his course online. There's plenty of work, but it's not impossible. Just time consuming. Midterm was easy. All you had to do was memorize. The final was a challenge, but if you keep retaking previous quizzes, you'll be fine. If you get A's on everything except the final, then the lowest grade you'll get is a B.",4.5,2.0,"May 22nd, 2012",145402
95,"Took the online 8 week class. The syllabus was very clear, there were no surprises. Really need to read the book to get an A, which is a chore but do-able. Some of the test bank Q's are out of date/don't match the book, but otherwise the tests are easy if you read and do the quizzes as many times as necessary.",5.0,3.0,"Aug 10th, 2011",145402

5983,"Kirk rarely gave any partial credit, and if he did it was minimal. There were 6 tests and a final throughout the semester. Tests were 5 points and an epsilon-delta proof for extra credit. 5 questions each, 100 points in total. If you missed an answer, without partial credit it was hard to get a C much less an A. Nice guy, just not a good grader",5.0,4.0,"Oct 12th, 2016",13432
5984,He gives lot of examples in class but doesn't give great notes. He is a really good teacher and will answer any questions you ask him. I will probably be taking him again for Calc 2.,4.5,5.0,"May 16th, 2016",13432
5985,"So, I am very confused how to rate Prof. Lancaster. Overall, he is one of the most caring and helpful professors I have ever had, and I feel like I learned a lot about Calc II. However his grading scale is horrible. He doesn't assign hw and all of your grade is based off of your tests. So it is up to you to practice and prepare yourself.",1.0,5.0,"May 10th, 2016",13432

5987,"He went over only a handful of problems each class period, and he goes through them expecting us Calc 2 students to remember everything we've learned in math thus far. Be sure to remember every trig identity you ever learned and then some. He has given chances to make up points for our abysmal test scores though. Overall not my style of teacher.",4.5,3.0,"Aug 18th, 2014",13432

5989,He does not assign homework or give a study guide for exams. He will let you take the test as many times as needed but will keep changing the test. You must pass four tests just to get a C. He gets irritated easily if a student does not understand a topic right away.  Some students took the first test 13 times and failed.,5.0,4.0,"May 10th, 2014",13432

5991,"Easily my favorite professor.  Prior to his class I perceived math as tedious work, but now I enjoy studying it and look forward to class each day.

5994,Kirk is NOT FOR THE LAZY. Requires FAR more work in than necessary to pass. His honors grading makes getting an A as hard as trying to run in a nightmare. He gets frustrated when you don't understand. Assigns NO homework so NO motivation. Retake tests unlimited times. Must pass 10 tests for an A. Each test = 45min. Takes 3-5 attempts per test.,2.0,5.0,"May 3rd, 2013",13432
5995,"Lancaster is only a good teacher if you have already passed a calculus class of the same level previously.

5996,Definetley wants to see his students pass. This class requires a massive amount of effort and attendance is therefore mandatory. Test are by no means easy but he is willing to do retakes.

6000,The most difficult math class I've ever taken. He teaches almost solely from examples. Test are impossible and because class averages are so low he had us retake each test multiple times. We ended up taking 6 midterms. He does offer a lot of outside help coming in on his own time but I still couldn't understand the material with his expectation,4.5,3.0,"Jan 16th, 2012",13432

Not because you aren't smart enough, but because most of what he goes over in lecture will not make sense if you can't understand his accent and way of explaining things,  which leads to not understanding the material if you never taken a stats course bef",3.5,3.0,"May 22nd, 2009",50251

6557,He is hard to understand. I came to class everyday and took notes. This class would've been easier but our book was bad too. We had to correct many things in the book. We did almost every homework problem on the board because students didn't understand the material he covered(or because mistakes in the book made problems impossible to solve).,5.0,3.0,"Nov 24th, 2004",50251

6570,Daowei Ma was overall a great professor. Grading on Exams was fair and Homework was reasonable. Made Jokes during class to lighten the mood. Easy to approach and was willing to help.
