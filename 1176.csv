EASY A.', 'Dr. Neal was a good professor. He gives study guides for his test, which the test are the same thing as the study guide, but different numbers. He tells you when you should expect a pop quiz, so study for them. This quizzes will be added onto your test grade, so if you do not do good on them, it will reflect on your test.', 'Dr. Neal is a great professor. He is very funny which keeps the classes interesting during the lectures. He gives study guides for the test and they are just like the test.', 'He used a lot of terminology (and a lot of Greek letters) that scares the average person.

I retook the class at a later date with a different professor and made a B.', ""Dr. Neal's Calc 2 class was interesting in that it's probably one of the easiest at WKU and easier than his Calc 1 (He skipped a few trickier topics). He's a funny guy with a ton of personality, so you won't be bored. There are like 7 tests which are your only grades, but he posts study guides which are nearly identical. Also, don't skip class!"", 'Dr. Neal teaches you math from A-Z, but all of the homework and tests go from Z-A, but he won\'t tell you how to do that.  I started failing all assignments after day 2.  Even though he ""gives you everything that you need to know for each test"", the grading scale is ridiculously hard and not-realistic (77D). Avoid this professor at all costs.', ""I doubt you'd find anyone that knows math on campus better than this guy, and pretty funny. The only bad thing about the class was the grading scale, essentially meaning you need at least a 78%, his version of a C, if you want to pass. Would take him again if not for that."", ""Dr. Neal is a really cool guy and a pretty good professor. Great to ask questions. I never really learn much from his classes, but I do enjoy them. He gives a study guide which is everything you need to know for his tests so if you don't do well, you probably didn't put enough time into it. He is very uptight on test day though. Don't cheat."", 'His grades scale is super hard, 70-77 is D', 'Really enjoyed going to his class.', ""I had Neal for Calc 1. Great teacher, funny guy. There isn't another professor I would take for calculus"", 'Hard teacher, but I denfinely would take him again.', ""I thought he was a pretty okay teacher, the first day he scared us all by going through the material super-fast and not stopping for questions. After that, it calmed down. He taught MWF and the teaching assistant taught TR. I went to him many times outside of class, but he wasn't very helpful.. I went to the math lab for help with calculus instead."", ""Dr. Neal is a good teacher and really enjoys teaching math, but he is a tough grader. He has a nontraditional grading scale. Ex: Above 93% is an A & anything below 78% is not a C. He says a lot of jokes in class, and he gives you a study guide for each test. If you do the study guides, you're OK. Just be prepared to work hard for the grade you want"", 'Overall, he was a very good teacher. He was very clear and made concepts easy to understand. However, his grading scale was ridiculous. I got fairly good grades on the tests and still got a bad grade. If you want to work extra hard for an average grade then this is the class for you. He is very helpful in respect to learning the material. ', ""Dr. Neal has got to be the funniest man at WKU, I'm not kidding! His class is pretty different from most math professors, in that he gives a lot of tests which are very clear cut. He'll give you a study guide beforehand about what he wants you to know, and the test is the same model, just with different numbers. I'd recommend him for any math class"", ""He doesn't give extra credit. On the bright side, you don't have to do homework. That is a blessing and a curse, though, because your only grades are 6 tests. He has a website that explains each lesson and test study guides that look almost identical to the actual tests. He's pretty funny, but this class is pretty difficult -- subject-wise."", ""I loved Neal's class. It was a MTWRF class, but he made it to where we did not have to come on T & R since he would have an aid teaching those days. No homework. Only tests for grades, but he puts literally a near identical review test online to review before the actual test (he just changes the numbers on the actual test)."", ""Although Neal gives a tough grading scale, he gives tons of partial test credit. He makes the material easy to understand and happy to teach. He assigns tests about every other week which was good for this class because the tests didn't cover much material. Reviews are just like the test. If you study, you'll be fine. No textbook used."", ""I took Dr. Neal for Introductory to Stats and for this class he is a great teacher, although it will be hard to get the grade you want unless you are a good test taker. +95 in the class is an A. No homework. 5 tests. He is pretty funny and engaging so going to class isn't a problem. Just be ready to work for that A. I wouldn't take him for calculus""]","[""Skip class?
