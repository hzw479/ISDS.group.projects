BUT THEY ARE BORING. they feel like they are 5 hours long instead of an hour and 15 minutes. gets off topic a lot too so its hard to write notes. just go to class and pay attention and youll pass. also, if you ask a question and she thinks its dumb she will freak out.

1,"Lectures are long but the tests are based entirely off of the lecture if you go to class and take good notes you will be fine. She is extremely knowledgeabl, some people think she comes across rude, i have had 6 classes from her and after teaching for 40 years she knows he wants to be there to learn and who doesn't care and that' how she treats you",4.0,4.0,"Oct 16th, 2015",148559
2,Dr Adams is one of the nicest and best professors I had at Uc.  I took both her world cultures 1 & 2.  Her class is all lecture.  Listen to her take good notes and you are honing to pass.  Her tests are based directly on her lecture.   Nothing is hidden or not covered.   SHE will NOT tolerate disrespect.  Go to class pay attention.,1.0,3.0,"Aug 5th, 2013",148559
3,"Very knowledgeable, mostly straightforward class. The entire course is lectures and tests taken from the notes from the lectures. Book is unnecessary because all tests are taken from notes. Not a ""fun"" class, but attendance is necessary to understand tests. Overall good teacher.",2.0,4.0,"Jan 6th, 2013",148559
4,"I really enjoyed having her as a professor, she gives fair tests of which if you payed attention the entire time in class you will do fine. she does go off topic a lot but be thankful of that for it is unnecessary and shortens what you actually have to learn.",3.0,4.0,"Jan 10th, 2011",148559

11,"Dr. Adams expects a lot, but she is also very fair. She finds various ways of giving extra points, like if you attend an event on campus. She does expect you to do your work, but I don't mind that - it is what I am paying for.
