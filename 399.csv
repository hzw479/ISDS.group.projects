Especially  the way the assignments and reading taught APA and scientific writing. It was very well designed, and effective. Professor Weissmark interacts with everyone, which is great, and the TAs were outstanding.', 'Dr. Weissmark is a heroine in my view.  She is the perfect representation of one who can reconcile people from different walks of life whose ancestor were either victim of unjust treatment or whose ancestor induced violence.   Unequivocally, Dr. Weissmark is an excellent professor. With that said, I encourage serious students to take her course. Keep in mind; you will find her to be highly informative but yet challenging. Hence,  I know that you will leave her course with a vast knowledge of ""Psychology of Diversity.""', 'Dr. Weissmark responds to emails promptly.  She takes the initiative to reach out to her students to learn about their concerns. For instance, she took the time out of her busy schedule to email me on a few occasions with regards to voicing my concerns. On another occasion, she took the time to return my phone call to aid my concerns. In truth, she must go down in history as the most concerned professor at Harvard University.', 'Dr. Mona Weissmark is the best professor that I have ever had at Harvard University. Her teaching is precise and concise. I profoundly enjoyed her methodical teaching style. In every class session, she always conveys a PowerPoint presentation. Her teachings are amazingly insightful.  As a matter of fact, I enjoy her teachings so much that I purchased two of her amazing books. One is entitled ""Legacies of the Holocaust and World War II: Justice Matters"".  In all sincerity, that is the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. The other book is entitled ""Doing Psychotherapy Effectively"".  She is so passionate about teaching "" Diversity of Psychology"", that she always post scholarly sources on her tweeter page.

I feel better prepared in social science research, but also in being a better person.', 'I took Psychology of Diversity with Professor Weissmark at Harvard Summer School in 2013.

Just make sure you do the readings, review lecture notes, and peer review your midterm and final paper.', 'Professor Weissmark is professional in her teaching and shares her knowledge selflessly. Her lectures were intellectual and enlightening as well as fun. The pacing of her lectures were properly scheduled to kept my interest in the topics. She is also inspiring, humorous and witty in her lectures. It is an amazing journey for the course PSYC-E 1507.', 'Very easy class. Her lectures are alright. Whats really amazing is her ability to facilitate a discussion. She asks some very thought provoking questions and really stimulates a conversation.
