0,Professor Abramova's class was interesting and informative. She is very helpful and kind. Lots of opportunity for extra credit and bonus points. She is intelligent and enjoyable. Excellent professor!!!!,5.0,2.0,"Jan 6th, 2014",1338403
1,"She does have a russian accent which makes some understanding difficult, however if you read the chapters it will fill in any holes. I got A's in her class. Most people just aren't willing to do their ""homework"" and studying is the only homework. She teaches from the book so if you put in a little effort you can glide through the class.",3.0,3.0,"Oct 20th, 2010",1338403
2,Harder to understand but gives a lot of bonus of quiz and exam,2.0,2.0,"Jun 30th, 2010",1338403
3,"The class was very difficult to follow, as she was very disorganized in her presentations and notes. Her lectures were difficult to understand due to her thick accent. If you are in her class, and do not understand chemistry very well, get a tutor intermediately.",1.0,5.0,"Jan 26th, 2010",1338403
4,"Natasha has trouble teaching chemistry because of her strong Russian accent. Along with this, she lacks organization and clarity with her in class notes. Be ready to do a lot of self teaching in this class!",1.0,4.0,"Oct 19th, 2009",1338403
5,Hardest class I have ever taken. He starts the class saying that no answers are wrong answers as I proceeded to receive 3 D's in a row on 3 consecutive tests and quizzes when I tried my hardest to answer the questions fully to my best ability.,1.0,4.0,"Aug 22nd, 2020",2487898
6,Therese is an amazing teacher who is willing to meet with you anytime you need and will do the work with you. Reading the book is a must since she breezes through lectures. She post her lectures with each module but leaves out some important details that are only found in the book.,3.0,4.0,"May 12th, 2021",1976041
7,"Therese is an amazing person, through and through. She publishes lectures on Canvas and then goes over them again in class, but doesn't really elaborate or answer questions efficiently. In other words, she wastes class time. Quiz and test heavy, big time! Gives no helpful feedback. Office hours are hard to get into. Doesn't explain material well.",4.0,4.0,"Mar 31st, 2021",1976041

10,"Therese is wonderful at what she teaches. The material is difficult, but she is more than willing to meet with you outside of class even up to the last minutes before an exam. She is supportive and approachable, I would definitely take another class with her again.",4.0,3.0,"Dec 7th, 2017",1976041
11,The tests are worth a lot but they aren't super tough and she gives out study guide/worksheets that tell you exactly what will be on the test. Sometimes the practice questions she gives are the exact same as the test. She is also very approachable and is always willing to help. Lectures are very informative.,5.0,5.0,"Oct 26th, 2016",1976041
12,"Mrs. Anderson is a wonderful teacher and knows how to come at a concept many different perspectives. She wants you to learn, and I want her for all my science classes.",5.0,4.0,"Jan 12th, 2015",1976041
13,"I took her for organic chem lab. I received an A- because i wasn't sure how she grades pre and post labs. If i have taken her for gen chem, i should have received better grades because i would've known how she grades and what she looks for in the lab notebook More than helpful if you get help from her! Loved her lab, except for the final grade",,,,1976041
14,"Strict about attendance and late work, but really kind and professional and knows a lot about writing. He was always happy to give extra help. I would love to take another class with him because I became a much better writer after taking his EH 123 section. If you just want an easy class without much writing, I'd suggest finding another section.",5.0,3.0,"Aug 26th, 2014",1856599
15,"Incredibly disorganized, very opininated. Can never tell whether he's going to be in a good mood or bad mood. Overall nice, but never follows through on what he says he will do (post grades, give back papers) Haven't really learned much in his class. Don't recommend this professor.",1.5,3.0,"Nov 26th, 2013",1856599
16,"There were no surprises with this course. Everything that is expected is clearly outlined in the syllabus. Tests are a heavy weight in the course, but he prepares you very well. He was also super accommodating and available outside of class with and questions or concerns I had. I highly recommend taking a class with this professor!",5.0,3.0,"May 5th, 2020",1459305

19,"Nice teacher, funny. Did a lot of group work and he would go to every group to answer questions, but wouldn't go back to your group until he went to everyone else. So if you were on question one and didn't have a question he would move to the next group, when you realized you had a question on question two you had to wait a while for him to return.",2.5,3.0,"Apr 24th, 2016",1459305
20,Very good when it comes to helping. Able to dumb things down to a students level instead of a doctorate level. Understanding of missing class but would rather you are there. Has very clear expectations on tests including sample tests. ALOT of group work.,2.0,5.0,"Nov 11th, 2015",1459305
21,Hes a very hard grader and expects you to know so much already ,2.5,3.0,"Nov 9th, 2015",1459305

24,Overall a good professor. He is super easy but you can learn a lot if you apply yourself. Group work made up most of this course and was not difficult at all.,4.5,4.0,"Oct 28th, 2011",1459305
25,"He is tough on tests, but he makes the material interesting, and as long as you do the homework you can make up for the low test grades. He is always willing to help with office hours and e-mail, but its not a class you can go into, not work and get a great grade.",3.0,4.0,"Oct 17th, 2011",1459305
26,"Very easy to do homework on WebWork. He is nice and helpful but the tests are VERY HARD. Consists of about 6 questions, word problems. He gives partial credit but still impossible to pass.",2.5,2.0,"Apr 27th, 2011",1459305
27,"""Dr. J"" is a cool guy and extremely intelligent. He uses Webassign and weighs that part of the course heavily, so even with a poor test average it is easy to get at least a B. His lectures are very dense and his explanations are not very clear, but he is very generous with his office hours and will help you in any way he can.",3.5,3.0,"Sep 7th, 2010",1459305

29,"I enjoyed the class and think that Professor Beaupre does well making sure her students all succeed. There is a bit of homework after every class, but it is not extremely difficult if you show up and pay attention in class.",3.0,2.0,"Dec 18th, 2020",2148925
30,"His handwriting looks like Russian cursive. It's impossible to decipher. He spends maybe 20 minutes per class on the material and then has ""small group"" discussions which are pointless. Vocab quizzes are tough: He wants the definitions verbatim to the book.",1.0,5.0,"May 3rd, 2016",2049261
31,Terrible experience in this class wasn't helpful at all and won't work with you. Tells you the only way you will pass this class is if you go to the tutor 2-3 times a week along with the three times a week you have the class,1.0,5.0,"Mar 3rd, 2016",2049261
32,I took algebra with Benjamin and it was the worst class I have ever taken. You can hardly read is writing on the board and his instructions are very unclear. He gives long homework assignments and grades really tough. I would not recommend his classes to anyone.,1.0,5.0,"Nov 2nd, 2015",2049261
33,"This class was very hard. The homework assignments are extremely long, and the quizzes are even worse. For the midterm you have to study hundreds of words just for 35 of them to be on the test. Lectures can seem to drag on and it is hard to understand him and his handwriting. I would not take this class again. Thank god it's just a refresher course",1.0,5.0,"Oct 22nd, 2015",2049261
34,"This is not a class that you just go to lecture and pass, if you want the best out of Karl ASK questions in class and do your reading!!! Karl is a really smart and great guy who expects a lot out of you.

36,"Karl knows what he is talking about but his ""teaching style"" involves no teaching at all. He reads his lecture for 50 minutes and then class is dismissed. The only grades that get entered are quizzes and exams which are very hard. That's right homework is not graded. I do not understand how he expects students to be able to do well in his class.",2.0,5.0,"Mar 23rd, 2020",1239483
37,"Karl is a smart professor and he knows what he is talking about. But his quizzes are incredibly hard, he puts things that only someone with a few years of chemistry would know, not someone in their second semester of college. He asks too much of his students on his quizzes. This course tanked my GPA and is the only class I received a C in.",1.0,5.0,"Nov 29th, 2019",1239483

41,This professor is not helpful at all. I had to fight tooth and nail for my B. Assessments were unfair and rarely pertained to anything that we learned. Do not take him. Avoid at all costs.,5.0,3.0,"Oct 31st, 2018",1239483
42,He gives homework but it's not mandatory. He knows what he's talking about and is very helpful.,1.0,4.0,"Jun 8th, 2018",1239483
43,"Simply an unpleasant human being. Do not for any reason, take a class with this man. He takes so much pleasure in seeing students fail and gives ZERO leeway for making up late work. He was unhelpful in the multiple times I went to get extra help during office hours. This is the first class I have ever had to retake.",4.0,3.0,"Mar 28th, 2018",1239483
44,"I love this guy. Very funny, absolutely brilliant. Beware of his tests, he pulls that ""Not technically due to fine print"" stuff sometimes. However, a lot of his test questions come from the homework, so people that complain don't actually try. His lectures are really thorough. He and Kennard are both solid choices. He will laugh at any joke.",1.0,5.0,"Nov 30th, 2016",1239483
45,Dr. Bishop is absolutely no help at all. If you are looking for a teacher you can communicate with DO NOT take him. His tests are unbearable even when you study. He goes fast in lectures and does not like to answer questions. Worst professor I ever had at Husson.,3.5,4.0,"Apr 16th, 2016",1239483
46,I thoroughly enjoyed having Dr. Bishop as a teacher for both Chem 1 and 2. Expect a lot of cheesy dad jokes and he tends to have technical difficulties with his computer often during class which is amusing to watch. Just do the example problems in the book and you'll be just fine.,2.5,3.0,"Aug 6th, 2015",1239483
47,"I wish that in the second half of the Chemistry course, he was more helpful, however, I really liked his teaching style and I would really like to take him again",4.0,4.0,"Apr 26th, 2015",1239483
48,"Dr. Bishop expects you to work. If you say he is awful, note that this is college, not high school. Tests are tough, but problems are DIRECTLY from the booklectures. LEARN the material in science classes; topics build on each other. If you only memorize stuff for the test and then forget it, you are sunk. LEARN don't memorizeregurgitate & forget!",3.0,4.0,"Sep 14th, 2014",1239483
49,"Dr. Bishop is not for beginners. If you are a freshman, have never taken a science class, are not up to par with the math I would advise finding another professor. He is a good professor who clarifies the understanding he expects you to already have. If you don't have this understanding or aren't willing to do the work, you will have a hard time.",3.0,5.0,"Dec 28th, 2013",1239483
50,"One of the most difficult professors I have every met. The only grades that ""go in the book"" are 5 exams and a final exam. They are not easy but he grades fairly and you know the general content that will be on them. You really have to apply yourself to pass this class with Bishop. I ended up learning a lot though and I would recommend him.",4.5,5.0,"Apr 26th, 2012",1239483
51,"Bishop is a hard teacher, and his tests and quizzes are both hard as hell. But I have never learned more from a teacher. And he is also very nice and very helpful. Anyone who says he isn't is lying, or never asked for help.",2.0,4.0,"Dec 19th, 2010",1239483
52,"I love chemistry, but his class is unbearable. The daily quizzes are insanely difficult. The info is from the book. But the questions are so obscure they're hard to get right. You can either get a 0, 50, or 100. He's not flexible and his exams are notoriously difficult. Be prepared to study and teach yourself a lot on your own.",1.5,5.0,"Aug 12th, 2010",1239483
53,"He is a horrible teacher. He never takes time to do example problems during class. When I have tried to ask for help he often doesn't answer or help but says, you should know this we went over it in class, or this is in you book, look it up. Not helpful at all. Tests are very hard. AWEFUL INSTRUCTOR!",3.5,5.0,"Jul 12th, 2010",1239483
54,"Good teacher. He creates hand-outs which are identical to what he lectures, so you don't need to take a lot of notes. Everything that is need to know is right in the book. So all the rest of you people who think he is aweful - you obviously didn't read the book enough!",,,,1239483
55,"I have more gripes against the computer program/system than I do against the professor. Prof. Bourgoin is quite nice and respectful, but if you have a question, she makes you look in the eText before she helps you. The software used, sucks. Because its a computer, things have to be done ONE way. If you get the right answer differently, its wrong.",4.0,1.0,"Oct 28th, 2015",2054174
56,"Ms. Bragg was an excellent teacher. The class was not easy but she really made ethics interesting, which I did not expect.

59,I took this class in spring of 2014. This is an intro class in video. Expect the basics of editing and shooting. There were some cool projects but you are not free to do whatever you want. They are pretty specific assignments and missing one will hurt your grade. Bridges is approachable and enthusiastic like most of the other video department guys.,4.0,2.0,"Jul 26th, 2015",1969748
60,"This class had potential to be very useful, even though the given subject matter is mostly review for students with any prior background in film and video. However, the utter lack of imagination from the instructor, Kris Bridges, gives way to a pallid shell of a class completely devoid of inspiration, entertainment, or useful experience. It sucks.",3.0,3.0,"Dec 24th, 2014",1969748
61,"This course was my hardest class I took that semester but also the one I learned the most in.

62,"I have had Dr. Brooks for 4 classes now. He has very high expectations, but you learn a lot. He writes on the board and does not use power points so yo uhave to show up for class. In biomechanics you have to build a leg that jumps, lot of stress but in the end very fun. I never had to do a project like that in any other class. Learned a lot",1.0,4.0,"Apr 30th, 2021",1552533
63,He contradicts himself and other professors routinely and just gives overall confusing lectures infused with pointless stories about himself and family that are in no way relevant to the course material.

65,I got a grade on one of his exams that I was proud of but he was disappointed in it. He confronted me at the beginning of class and said that he expected more from me. That my score was lower than it should've been and that he was disappointed. I left the class crying and avoided him the rest of the semester.

68,He is by far one of the best professors at Husson. He is super knowledgeable and is the best at teaching and lays it all out for you.

Would recommend!,4.0,4.0,"Nov 8th, 2018",1552533
69,You will learn the most from him but your grade may not reflect it. He does pop quizzes constantly to ensure you are studying honestly its a great way to stay on track.
