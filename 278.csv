The class is really accessible and low-commitment, but also fun. Would recommend this class and her as a professor!', 'Claire was great and really cared about the subject. She also really wanted us to care about the subject and tailored her lessons to class preferences as the semester went on and she got to know us better. She made it really interesting, even for those of us who had never studied classics before.', ""Claire is an amazing, thoughtful, and humorous teacher.

The readings were enjoyable, didn't take too much time, and she is fair in terms of grading and tests. You won't regret taking a class with her!"", ""Fantastic professor.

If you're taking a class and have a choice between another professor and Catenaccio, choose her every time."", 'Really enjoyed this class!
