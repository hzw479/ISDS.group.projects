1,hes really nice and for some reason he gave me an a in fye. i never did anything and skipped like 3 papers and still got an a! i think he just assigns the reflection papers to say he assigned something!  you have no choice in who is your fye teacher but if you get him... your good to go!!!,5.0,1.0,"Jan 1st, 2006",791240
2,"I would definitely stay away from this professor. He makes this class ridiculously much harder than it needs to be. All of his tests are short answer, and he does nothing to prepare you for the metanarrative exam (required for all exploring the bible classes) at the end. He basically stands in front of the class and preaches to the class. AVOID HIM",2.5,5.0,"May 5th, 2014",1897852

8,"She is tough but she is smart. Was scared of her as a teacher because she would make you work for your grade. I think she thought I was dumb in class, but outside she seemed to love me lol. Suffered through her lab classes but learned more from her than I did from Lobdell. Sad that she left PBA.",1.0,5.0,"Apr 29th, 2019",1412945
9,"This woman could teach anything her heart sets out to teach. I know she may come off as ""tough"" sometimes, but it's all for the sake of good, quality learning. I had her for Orgo 1 AND 2. Labs included. She is one of the best instructors I have ever had, if not the best. Get ready to work!!",5.0,4.0,"Mar 31st, 2016",1412945

11,"This is who you want for Organic Chemistry. Had her for Organic 2 and she is a quality teacher. The best one on campus!  Wish I had taken her for Organic 1 also. I love that she repeats past concepts in her teaching, you will leave knowing the material. You just have to focus on this class and do your part in studying. She is awesome! ",5.0,3.0,"Aug 31st, 2015",1412945
12,Well lets just say I have had three really bad teachers in my life and she is one of them! I had Dr. Aleman for lecture.  She is very tough and does not teach well! Test are hard and she gives nothing of a review or anything! She excepts you to take a 9 to 10 chapter test and know everything in each chapters! ,1.0,5.0,"Dec 5th, 2014",1412945
13,"Students beware, worst professor ever! Expects you to know material before coming to class (this is chemistry, you cannot learn by yourself),  rude & demeaning if you ask questions, requires concept charts. Very confusing! Class exam averages  F. Take with another professor or somewhere else if you want to actually learn something and pass!",1.0,5.0,"Nov 6th, 2014",1412945
14,"I read all the good reviews on her. I don't know what happened to her when I got into her class. She's a smart lady, knows her stuff but she teaches as if we all came in with a doctorates in chemistry. It seems as if she gives pop quizzes to ""trick"" her students. Has very few office hours and is not much help when you go for help. Just don't.",1.5,4.0,"Nov 3rd, 2014",1412945
15,"This was the first time I took Chemistry since High School. With very little knowledge going in I found her teaching style to be demanding and very difficult to follow. She loves to pass sections saying ""You just have to know this"" without any further help. She loves to pass you off to a student intern if you need further help. Failed her class...",2.5,5.0,"Oct 31st, 2014",1412945
16,"Dr. Aleman runs her classroom very strictly and can come off as intense and overwhelming, especially in a difficult subject that students do not have previous knowledge on. She makes demoralizing comments to students, disrespects, criticizes, and belittles. The workload is quite large for a one credit lab class. ",1.5,4.0,"Oct 7th, 2014",1412945
17,"Not clear on assignments. syllabus due dates were all wrong. Maybe it way more difficult than it should be. I have changed majors due to the science teachers at this school, they focus on Jesus more than teaching science.",2.0,4.0,"Apr 23rd, 2014",1412945
18,"Nice person, but not a great professor for the beginner Chem student. She teaches as if you have prior knowledge of the course. If you do that's great but if not please take another professor. PBA doesn't offer a large picking pool of them. She knows her stuff just not how to teach it. The class is fast paced which doe't help either. Very nice tho.",1.5,4.0,"Dec 18th, 2013",1412945

21,AMAZING teacher. She is nice and understands what she is teaching.,5.0,3.0,"Mar 27th, 2013",1412945
22,"Definitely learned a lot in the class (Principles of Chemistry, Lecture). Most people thought she taught too fast. But she kinda had to because it is simply a fast paced class. It is a survey of six semesters of chemistry classes therefore it seems hard. Rarely used the book. Print off the slides ahead of time and read over them so you're prepared!",5.0,3.0,"Dec 18th, 2011",1412945
23,I can't believe she hasn't been rated! I had/still have her for chem lab. She likes to scare you away from chem. Alot of prepping for her labs. Haven't had her for lecture but I hear she really makes you learn chem which is good. Will really help you during office hours. really hard but good quality prof!,5.0,5.0,"Dec 1st, 2011",1412945
24,"Alvarado is in his own world. Classes require max effort to stay awake. The silver lining is that as long as you check in occasionally, you will be able to get an A or B. Very nice guy, and knows his material, just can't communicate it to save his sorry life. Smokin' hot though.",1.5,3.0,"Mar 21st, 2016",2043794
25,"He's a great professor, incredibly helpful. I've taken him for Cost acct, Tax 1 & 2, and I've always passed with a high grade. It's no picnic, and there are a lot of papers, but he's not a tough grader and tests are only on what he has taught (tax exams are really hard, but are take home with groups). All in all, I would definitely recommend him.",4.0,4.0,"Sep 27th, 2015",2043794

27,"Dr. Anderson is by far the toughest teacher I've ever had. She expects graduate level work and marks you down for every tiny mistake and anything that could have been better. She's kinda kooky and very entertaining. She cares about her students and is a literal GENIUS. Also, MEET WITH HER BEFORE EVERY PAPER! She's the best :)))",5.0,5.0,"Jan 18th, 2019",140099

29,"Dr. Anderson, is amazing, but get ready to work. She expects your work to be meticulously perfect, but if you listen to what she says, follow her instructions, and put in the work, you will grow incredibly, both as a person and a writer. She holds herself to this same level of perfection, takes time to befriend you, and offers incredible feedback.",5.0,5.0,"Nov 30th, 2018",140099

31,If you're looking for an easy class this is not the one for you. She expects a lot of reading and work outside of class and has quizzes on all of your reading. She assigns a lot of very long and very hard papers which she grades extremely hard. And if your not a fan of romance books like Wuthering Heights or Northanger Abby do not take this class.,1.0,5.0,"Oct 30th, 2017",140099
32,I took her several times she is amazing and she helped me with other English-y things outside of class (grad school applications and publications). She is hard. But the kind of hard that means you actually learned something and your education means something.,5.0,4.0,"Mar 8th, 2017",140099
33,If you don't like reading the do not take her. She expects you to read up to 50 pages between classes. There is a quiz on the reading every day. The class is all discussion and you have to learn a lot on your own.,1.0,4.0,"Nov 11th, 2016",140099
34,"Dr. Anderson is a very tough grader. She's clear about what she wants, but she expects near perfection by the end of the semester. Her strictness challenged me to improve, but at times it was frustrating. She can help you out a lot if you ask her to, but she's a stickler for formatting. Interesting but challenging class.",4.0,4.0,"Dec 27th, 2014",140099
35,"She really loves English and literature and her love comes out through her teaching. But if you are just taking a comp class I would highly advise not to take her.

36,"I took Anderson for HUM 3. Class was a little demanding, but for the most part it was okay. If you don't do your work you will SUFFER in her class! Read J.

52,He is very funny and its an easy class to pass. He only had us write two essays one was really long though. Just stay on top of the work and do good in the HW grades and you can get an A.

53,Honestly would NOT recommend him. Cool guy but hes so specific about his grading style. Its nothing what you learn in HS or even Comp 1. I just find it really hard to listen to him.

He comes across as rude and only if you prove yourself to him outside of class will he respect your efforts as a student.",5.0,3.0,"Jul 14th, 2016",588259
2484,"Dr. Z. is a favorite! Surely a bit intimidating, but he genuinely wants students to do well and provides them with the resources to do so--his expectations are always clear. Don't let his red pen scare you! Graded papers usually looks worse than they actually are. Oh, btw, DO NOT USE TECHNOLOGY in this class! Ever. Seriously. Just don't do it.",1.5,4.0,"Apr 29th, 2016",588259
2485,"My advice to anyone taking the class: participate, show up on time, show up, and read your book (a lot). At the beginning of the semester, the class was mostly based on discussion and participation, which was quite interesting. At the middle and to the end, Dr. Zombory would go on rants about his personal life and beliefs for sometimes 30 minutes",2.0,4.0,"Dec 7th, 2015",588259
2486,Classes are interesting but when you get to the test you're like--WHAT THE?! He's an OK teacher but his tests are awful. I wish his study guides were more guiding and less general. He can be sassy so be careful. He's full of his opinions and he's a little odd but interesting to watch-- he does weird stuff,2.5,5.0,"Nov 9th, 2015",588259
2487,"Tough grader on papers, his APA format is different than a typical APA format so go to the learning lab for the first paper. The online quizzes are usually pretty clear and the tests are a lot of information but clear, he does not try to trick you by making confusing questions. Extremely tough grader!",3.5,3.0,"Oct 8th, 2014",588259
2488,"He is very intelligent and competent, but loses his temper quickly. The biggest issue for me is that he tests your knowledge in more detail than he lectured on. He also sticks to a lot of personal history of the theorists rather than delving into their theory and exploring any scientific support for said theories. Never text in his class.  ",2.5,5.0,"Jul 28th, 2014",588259
2489,"He is rediculously hard in grading papers with his unique apa style that does not follow the writting center apa guidlines so be careful. Be sure to participate in class or he will mark your grade down. Also, be extremely careful what you say because he loses his temper fast.  Class discussions were interesting though.",3.5,5.0,"Jul 15th, 2014",588259
2490,"Dr. Z is arguably the best professor in PBA's psychology department. At first he may seem slightly intimidating, but I promise if you give him a chance, attend class, participate regularly, and work hard you will leave with more knowledge than you thought possible from one class. If you have a interest in psychologic research he is your go-to.",4.0,4.0,"Jan 8th, 2014",588259
2491,Dr. Zombory is a great professor. He's very tough but if you study hard and come to class you shouldn't have a problem. He makes the classes very interesting and will generally let class out early so I was always motivated to come to class.,5.0,4.0,"May 6th, 2013",588259
2492,"He is the most phenomenal professor I have ever had. If you don't like him, you either didn't enter in during class, didn't do your work, or are too close-minded to listen to different opinions on biblical/psychological topics. He is the toughest professor I've ever had, but also the wisest and most awesome. I wish all my classes were taught by him",2.0,5.0,"Apr 22nd, 2012",588259
2493,Dr. Zombory is highly intelligent and competent in his field. I would only take him if you don't have other pressing priorities. He tries too hard to be hard. It seems that he goes out of his way to be difficult. He made my semester extremely stressful,,,,588259
