She always helped clarify any concepts we had trouble with and made complex material in physiology actually digestible.",5.0,3.0,"Apr 7th, 2021",2226063

2,"Nice person, horrible professor. Expects us to watch 3+ hours a week of outside lecture videos and to attend 2-3 hour long synchronous classes where she talks about material that is not covered in the lecture videos. Her exams are illegible and she often goes over time or adds in abundant last minute material to study. Unorganized and annoying.",2.0,5.0,"Sep 22nd, 2020",2226063
3,"This is not the right professor to be teaching any type of patho physiology or pharmacology. Too monotone and extremely vague with her style of questioning / expectations of students. If you have this professor for either course, be prepared to learn on your own. She doesnt even respond to emails (I guess shes too good to help her students).",2.0,3.0,"Jul 24th, 2020",2226063
4,Such a disappointing professor. Seems confused by her own material. Her powerpoints are not organized coherently and riddled with errors. her lectures are tedious and slow.,2.0,5.0,"Feb 4th, 2020",2226063
5,"Nice lady. Fun-ish personality. Voice is very slow and can be monotone, doesn't help when learning patho or pharm. In general her lectures are completely disorganized and she focuses a lot on the neuro aspect of EVERYTHING. Tests vaguely reflect what she teaches in class. Nice person for sure, not a good teacher at all.",5.0,4.0,"Dec 2nd, 2018",2226063
6,"Just a fantastic lecturer and so, so knowledgeable. She has a uniquely calming voice and her enthusiasm for the material is contagious. I listen to her lectures at 1.5 or 1.75x when I playback on ECHO to study, but in class her slow speech is very helpful when learning new topics. Cannot recommend her enough.",5.0,4.0,"Jul 16th, 2018",2226063
7,Sally makes normally complicated subjects easy to follow! Her lecture style is like none other because she lectures straight from memory (with visual aids) rather than by reading of slides (we've all had those professors before). She goes through each topic slowly and makes everything so clear. Everyone who had Sally before loves her.,5.0,3.0,"Jan 14th, 2017",2226063
8,"Overall, the class material is difficult. However, she is amazing. She is really engaging and really really helpful. I feel blessed to have her teaching a difficult topic. She really tries to break it down into the most simplistic way possible. For reference, I've had her for pharm and patho 1 & 2.",,,,2226063

15,horrible and uncredible professor. poor quality and brings down the reputation of columbia.,1.0,1.0,"Oct 9th, 2019",2329079
16,"While she is very kind & knowledgable when it comes to policy, her lectures were incredibly dry, unclear & not informative. She'd have powerpoints with 100 slides, but we'd only get through 10; she's not a great facilitator so class discussions were all over the place & too long. I don't feel I actually learned many concrete concepts & skills.",2.0,3.0,"Dec 27th, 2017",2329079
17,"Hassan was an excellent Professor. He was ideal for this class, as he was able to tutor me not just on a theoretical level, but also using his expertise as a Career Mastermind. I highly recommend that Hassan teach other classes. We need Professors that truly care, and are not apathetic (I have found that some are). Thank you Hassan!!",5.0,3.0,"May 22nd, 2018",2363659
18,"Brilliant Professor! One of the last pieces of advice (of many) he gave me before graduating was that your greatest asset is your current job, as you will be using it as a bridge job for the next job and it will help market you (along with references you align); protect it, leverage it, maximize it! He rocks! He should teach more classes!!!!!!!!",5.0,5.0,"May 9th, 2018",2363659
19,"Of all the professors I have taken at Columbia, he is the most fresh and innovative. What he says MAKES SENSE, and gives analogies that are really invaluable If I wouldn't have taken this class, I would have been lost, as my career track isn't that straightforward and he made it clear for me. He prepares you for the ""future of meaningful work"".",5.0,4.0,"May 9th, 2018",2363659
20,"A must take professor at the Sch of Professional Studies. He teaches you about personal branding and positioning in your career, as well as playing well in the sandbox.

21,"He should be teaching leadership, one of my favorite professors of all time! Take his class! He motivated me to not second guess myself and add true meaning to my career/life vision. He shared a framework on how to align my purpose and I have never gotten that kind of career coaching before. No surprise he has so many thank you cards in his office!",5.0,3.0,"Apr 19th, 2018",2363659

23,"Professor Albanese is definitely knowledgeable, and she's kind. Her class is quite easy. I rated her poorly because every single class you will be bombarded with talk of her political opinions. Every class is about patriarchy, sexism, racism, etc., instead of focusing on the literature.",2.0,1.0,"Nov 4th, 2018",1696418
24,She's great. Light course load. Student presentations take up most of the class period. This course helped me become better at close reading and analyzing texts.,4.0,2.0,"May 13th, 2018",1696418
25,"Prof Albanese is one of the best I've had at Bing. She really pushes students to be better thinkers and totally changed the way I analyze texts and write. I don't know what the other reviewer means about her being pretentions, she is pretty much the opposite of that. Only time I remember her cutting students off, they were saying offensive stuff.",5.0,3.0,"May 7th, 2018",1696418
26,Gives pretentious feedback that is difficult to decipher and find the meaning of. Cuts students off while their talking in discussion if she doesn't agree or if the student is wrong and doesn't explain. Doesn't give clear expectations for papers and grading and is always on her phone and not paying attention during presentations.,2.0,4.0,"Apr 29th, 2018",1696418
27,"Amazing professor. She doesn't baby you and takes student's interests seriously (she even asks our input for the syllabus/classroom activities). Don't take her if you need essay prompts or hand holding but an awesome class if you are considering graduate school or just want some flexibility. Young, laid-back, cool clothes.",5.0,2.0,"Apr 13th, 2018",1696418
28,"participate a lot, brought my first paper to her twice before handing it in and making sure everything was okay.. still gave me a B. not sure what it takes to do well in her class if I constantly ask for help on papers and do everything I can to perfect then and still just don't do well.",3.0,4.0,"Mar 16th, 2018",1696418
29,Mary Grace is smart and funny. The syllabus is non-traditional and heavier on politics and race than I expected. Her assignments can be confusing because they're open ended and she is always changing the syllabus. However she responds to emails quickly and is approachable and enthusiastic. She definitely cares about her students.,5.0,3.0,"Dec 19th, 2017",1696418

33,"Prof Albanese is fine. Her lectures are boring and we were graded on two papers, one was only 2 pages and the other was 5-7, and attendance. You don't have to do any of the readings except for the ones you're writing your paper on. She's also an easy grader. The only reason I showed up to class was for the attendance points",3.0,2.0,"Nov 2nd, 2017",1696418
34,"Despite other reviews, he's not arrogant. He's opinionated, but if you don't take it personally you'll discover that he's teaching you *how* to think, not *what* to think. While he tends to talk over people, just be patient. He truly cares about helping you understand the content.

38,"Terrible, terrible, terrible, smug, little self-important ""man"" wholly incapable of either writing or uttering one coherent sentence.  The man just babbles one disconnected thought after another.  He earned his degree in physics but does nothing in that field, hence why he turned to philosophy and is in the phil dept. Boring and an uncaring weirdo.",1.5,2.0,"Dec 22nd, 2007",17682
39,"I have no idea why Columbia doesn't fire him.  He has a reputation for being totally disconcern for teaching, which he is genuinely horrible at doing.  He clearly doesn't care about his students.  Just a terrible ""professor.""  And his books he himself wrote are equally horribly poor in quality.  I wish I knew about him before taking the course.",1.0,3.0,"Aug 22nd, 2007",17682
40,"The man simply cannot teach to save his life.  For the Direction of Time course, he used his own text, a horribly unreadable text.  He is also arrogant and not at all available.  No email replies or real feedback.  He's not a bad guy but has no business teaching--or writing.",1.0,3.0,"Dec 15th, 2006",17682
41,"This guy is awesome. He makes the material lively and down to earth, and responds really helpfully to student questions. Among the best few teachers I have had.

45,Dr. Alcantara is one of the most thoughtful professors I have ever had. She has high expectations but fully believes in her students' ability to meet those expectations.

I would retake this class over and over if I could!!",5.0,3.0,"Apr 12th, 2013",733550
50,"Took him for Creativity and Problem solving in music ed. People who criticize are looking for a fountainhead of information perhaps, and Randall is more about letting us make our own discoveries through the class activities and readings. He is VERY humble. He reinforced my confidence in thinking outside the box and gave me paths to success!",4.5,3.0,"Aug 4th, 2012",733550
51,"Be fair people. We are talking about a highly committed educator here. None of us are perfect, yet these professors work their hardest to ensure our education.

54,"Have to strongly disagree with the other reviews of Allsup. One of the best teachers I've had. Encouraged me to think about music in ways I never had, and to think critically about my real life teaching. Exceptionally thoughtful and engaged, and pushed me to imagine more of myself. Can't recommend him highly enough.",5.0,3.0,"Oct 28th, 2011",733550
55,"A very intelligent person. Needs to learn a little humility. His ideas on politics and education are definitely on the far left. As a professor, I hope he will learn to see the argument on all sides and NOT take sides. Objectivity is not one of his strengths.",1.5,3.0,"Nov 21st, 2010",733550
56,"This guy is full of himself. He speaks but says little that is useful, and he's no musician. He is a great example of the common assumption that music ed prof are unmusical and incomprehensible. TC should have much higher standards for their profs. They hired him because he graduated from here. Sorry, not good enough!",2.5,2.0,"Sep 10th, 2010",733550
57,"Allsup is overrated. He doesn't know much about real music making, or the real world of teaching today. He talks in circles. He sounds intellectual, but if you listen carefully, he isn't saying anything of consequence. Smooth, but full of postmodern nonsense. He's not nearly good enough to be at TC.",2.0,4.0,"Aug 17th, 2010",733550

I learned so much in such a short time!",5.0,3.0,"Aug 15th, 2016",1912223
73,Prof. Altshiler's class is life changing.  I was scared of public speaking and never believed that I could handle a trial.

She makes class interesting and exciting and real.",5.0,3.0,"Sep 21st, 2015",1912223
77,Prof Altshiler makes hard material much easier.  She uses stories from her actual trials to illustrate the rules of evidence and offers examples to make this difficult material come to life.

You feel like a hero; the professor nourishes your strengths, erases your weaknesses, makes you believe that you are an intelligent, capable adult and never talks down to you (like some professors tend to).
