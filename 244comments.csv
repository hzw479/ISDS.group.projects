Whenever I had a question about an assignment or asked him to look it over before I turned it in, he did it no problem and pretty quickly.",5.0,1.0,"Apr 27th, 2016",641213
1,"This professer makes too many excuses for curriculm accountability. He is old school and teaches 2003-2004 activities. Dr. Abate doesn't even present to his own student teachers the current APA standards. You will get nothing but excuses from this professor. The curriculum is not worth paying for, because it is extremely out of date. ",1.0,5.0,"Jun 8th, 2015",641213

6,This class was not bad at all! I dont know what all these negative reviews are about. He is a theater critic after all so any feedback he gives is to make you a better writer on the material. His class is not bad at all! Do not let the reviews scare you.,1.0,5.0,"Jun 29th, 2021",460572
7,"I agree with the other raters. The quizzes are easy but his grading of papers made no sense. When I fixed one thing he complained about, he would then complain about something else. I have no problem being intellectually challenged but I felt that there was no consistency in his grading. It feels like he wants to find something wrong in your essay.",4.0,4.0,"Apr 30th, 2021",460572

10,"Robert wants 750 word papers, but what he's expecting of you goes far beyond 750 words. Contacting him for feedback is an overwhelmingly negative experience with little actual feedback. Skip his classes if you can, not worth the hassle.",1.0,4.0,"May 1st, 2020",460572

12,"The most defeating and least caring professor I have ever experienced. Coming from a straight A student, who is a communication major I can say I hated this class. I reached out to him so many times for feedback and it's terrible and all he does is puts you down while grading. Honestly, worst professor I had in college.",1.0,5.0,"Oct 21st, 2019",460572
13,Horrible professor. The only reason I took his class because he was the only one teaching it and I needed it. He is never satisfied with the work you give in. He wants you to write like him. I rewrote my papers before submitting and attempted to write what I thought would be acceptable. He kept giving me a low score and harsh feedback.,4.0,3.0,"May 7th, 2019",460572
14,"Almost dropped Abelmans class at the beginning of the semester bc of all the negative ratings, but I'm so glad I didn't. He gives you a writing assignment and quiz, due at the end of two, sometimes three weeks. Writing is a 750 word minimum based off your critique of a movie, play, etc. Quizzes based off of his online lectures. Try, you'll pass.",1.0,4.0,"May 3rd, 2019",460572
15,"Felt like he graded very harshly and expected A LOT from his students. I managed to get decent grades on papers. However, I believe I got less than what I deserved. With that being said, he has no office hours and will only help you through email. For a class of this difficulty, it would make sense to get in person guidance.",3.0,4.0,"Nov 11th, 2017",460572
16,"Dr. Abelman is a very tough grader. Sometimes can get a little too critical in his responses (I've been called lazy and careless plenty of time). He knows his stuff though. One of few CSU profs to actually work as a journalist, so take advantage of that.",1.0,5.0,"Aug 15th, 2017",460572
17,"He was one of the worst professors I ever had, he was rude and argumentative. He does not care for others opinions or suggestions. His tests were almost impossible and they were very specific. He made attendance mandatory and if you missed a day it felt like you missed two weeks. And tons of READING, it was miserable.",1.0,4.0,"Jan 7th, 2017",460572
18,"Abelman test seem like they are set up for you to fail. The study guide is very unclear and he does not go into detail about specific material you need to know. Also he includes many things that were not discussed in lecture so make sure you READ,READ,READ. Can be quite rude at times, unavailable and opinionated.",1.0,4.0,"Jul 27th, 2016",460572
19,Didn't answer questions whenever I asked or made me too confused. Expected too much from students with such little time. He was funny here and there but I didnt enjoy his teaching style. Kinda a hypocrite,2.5,4.0,"Feb 8th, 2016",460572
20,He's extremely picky on papers and is a tough grader. Don't take this if you're looking for an easy WAC class. It's not easy. You have to read the book thoroughly in order to have a chance on the tests.,2.5,3.0,"Jan 12th, 2016",460572
21,"His classes were very fun because he kept them upbeat and somewhat humorous, but he was really unclear with his tests. Usually the quizzes and tests had nothing to do with the material covered in class/reading. The papers were short and graded easily.",1.0,5.0,"Aug 27th, 2015",460572
22,This was one of the more frustrating classes I've been in. The tests were not over the covered material in the class and were usually random footnotes in the book. The papers were unclear in direction and didn't help make up for the faulty test set up. Most of the lectures are full of tangents and remain unclear. Difficult course and professor.,5.0,5.0,"Feb 10th, 2014",460572
23,"Abelman is a great professor. If you expect a high school level class, or fail to keep an open mind, you may do poorly. He is a tough grader because unlike some other professors, he pushes his students to be their best. I learned more struggling through his classes than i have in any other course. He is very helpful & wants his students to succeed.",1.0,5.0,"Mar 29th, 2013",460572
24,Get as far as you can!!! There is no study guide. He does not give clear answers. Hard grader and you have to attend plays outside of class. If your not one of his favorites drop this class ASAP! This class was a waste of time and money!,5.0,1.0,"Dec 12th, 2012",460572

28,"My first impression of this teacher was terrible. He humiliated a student for walking into the wrong classroom while the entire class laughed. Ive never had a professor who is so self absorbed. He doesn't have a rubric for class projects, a prompt for projects, no study guides, and the book doesn't help. His expectations are so ambitious. WORST GUY",1.0,5.0,"Oct 15th, 2015",1420877

30,Professor does not explain assignments well. The class text book is useless when taking the class. He is not a good teacher and very self-absorbed. Several students dropped this class before mid-terms due to teach style.,1.0,4.0,"Dec 14th, 2013",1420877
31,Just not a very good instructor. Very self absorbed. The required text book is one written by himself which is a poorly written book.,1.5,4.0,"Oct 2nd, 2013",1420877
32,Honestly I was terrified taking this course with him because I have heard so many bad things. But he turned out to be a very nice and approachable professor. He's a very tough professor but if you put the time in it will definitely work in your favor. Really read the material and really be a critical thinker in his class.,3.0,5.0,"Aug 15th, 2012",1420877
33,He is a good teacher. He will give quizes often and both his quizes and tests are questions that are out of your notes and in the textbook. Some of the questions are very detailed so it is important to read your book. He sometimes tries to trick you with questions by wording them differnetly. When writing a paper or doing a project he is a very ver,4.5,3.0,"Oct 25th, 2010",1420877

36,"Honestly, the material was really difficult in this class but the professor didn't make it much easier to learn. Clear grading criteria but pretty much your grade comes down to the final. Went into the Final with an A and finished with a B. Midterm and Final are very difficult and NO other grade boosters. Entire class failed the quizzes. Meh!",3.0,2.0,"Jun 9th, 2018",1460423
37,"I recommend taking his differential Equations class only if you have taken differential equations before and want to get it over with. He only has two grades in the class. Midterm(the total of two tests throughout the semester)(60%) and the final (40%). Do not take the class if you are a lazy student, for you will not learn during the lectures",4.0,3.0,"May 20th, 2018",1460423
38,If you show up for every class and have a good understanding of the material you can pass this class. Best professor of this subject at CSU in my opinion. The only grades in this class are exams but he curves and gave a chance to redeem points missed on the exam.,4.0,4.0,"Dec 18th, 2017",1460423
39,A good lecturer who definitely understands the material inside and out. Kind of arrogant in his attitude/teaching style. If you really want to learn the material in the class he will teach it well.,4.0,4.0,"May 19th, 2017",1460423

47,Good professor. Very laid back. Examples in class were very similar to the test. Tests were open book open notes. If you went to class everyday and wrote down the example problems you got an A.,4.0,2.0,"Aug 29th, 2010",1460423

52,Sarah is an excellent professor. She is very caring and understanding. The assignments help ensure a successful transition into college. She can be easily reached outside of class and responds quickly. This is a pass/ fail class that doesn't count towards your GPA.,5.0,2.0,"Jan 4th, 2017",2222319

66,I really enjoyed his class.  He made the law very interesting.

6087,"This was probably my favorite class that I took this semester. I loved that we didn't just sit around and listen to boring lectures, most of the class consisted of continual conversation and participation. We also did role plays and practiced the material we covered on a weekly basis. There was one test and a couple papers, easy A!",4.0,2.0,"Dec 15th, 2016",2076026
6088,Professor Joyce is a good lecturer. He said he liked when the class participated and talked more than he did. I think our class learned more from his experiences being a professor mediator for 30+ years. Interesting guy and very funny. Papers aren't graded too harshly.,2.5,3.0,"May 10th, 2016",2076026
6089,"Fantastic professor. He creates a classroom where students have a great potential to learn. His class is different from most other classes I have been in.

6092,Dr. Judge is amazing and so knowledgeable in terms of psychology of aging. She is hilarious and makes the lectures fun when the topic we're discussing might not be super interesting. Her exams consist of multiple essay questions. She also only lectures and writes on the board so no powerpoints. Easily able to get an A if you apply yourself.,5.0,3.0,"Nov 22nd, 2019",280106

The exams were tough.",3.0,4.0,"Nov 20th, 2018",172153
6115,You can tell he really cares about what he's talking about. He gives three exams and the final is optional.

6119,"You can tell he loves his job but that doesn't make this class any easier. His tests are tricky. There are sometimes two right answers to a question.

12034,This class is definitely requires the utmost work to be put into it and you get little to nothing out of it.

14822,"Dr. Zorita was one of my favorite Spanish professors I've ever had. Some of his classes were difficult and others were easy. Although he has lived in this country well over 40 years, he has a thick accent when speaking English, but I understood him whether he spoke English or Spanish for the most part. A+ for him.",5.0,2.0,"Sep 30th, 2011",707129
14823,"Dr. Zorita was my favorite Spanish professor at CSU! I was kind of disappointed that he has retired...but the man is about 80 years old now. I hope all is well with him if he's still around. There were some classes I had with him that were harder than others, but I learned a lot!",4.5,3.0,"Sep 23rd, 2005",707129
14824,"Dr. Zurcher is clearly an intelligible person, but I personally struggled with his teaching style. However, he is super kind and he genuinely cares about his students understanding the material. He responds to emails super fast, and gives homework extensions if you have a good reason. His exams are very hard, but he grades with a bit of leniency.",4.0,5.0,"Dec 7th, 2020",679057

His exams are very tough but gives a lot of partial credit. He has this very charming and wholesome personality that makes the class so much better.",5.0,3.0,"Mar 5th, 2020",679057

14828,"He is a good guy and a nice professor, has lenient grading for a difficult class. As long as you do all the homework, and attend class for the quizzes you are guaranteed a decent grade. Tests are extremely hard but as long as you write equations you receive credit.",3.0,4.0,"Aug 7th, 2019",679057
14829,"Tough class and exams don't test that you know the material-they test that you fully understand and can apply it to difficult scenarios. If you go to class and complete all the homework, the lenient grading scale will get you an A or B.

14831,"I don't go to CSU, but I took 1 and 2 over the summer. Dr. Z is a great professor! With crammed summer courses, keeping up with the material is a little harder, especially if you missed class. He grades quite lenient, and tries to give you as much credit as possible! He answers emails very quickly and explains things pretty well. 10/10 recommend!",5.0,3.0,"Aug 14th, 2018",679057
14832,I took physics 2 during the summer. I do not go to CSU as my home university so I was a little unsure going into the class. I feel that his current ratings on rate my professsor scared me coming in. You have to study for the class but as long as you put the correct formulas for the exams he gives you almost full credit.

14834,"Dr. Zurcher is a professor who is too smart for his own good. He is way above students in physics intelligence and sometimes poorly explains things. His lectures can get confusing too. His grading scale offers great opportunity for at least a B, despite his exams being absurdly difficult. Avoid taking him at all costs. Not worth the stress.",4.0,4.0,"Aug 30th, 2016",679057
14835,"Zurcher is a great teacher. His accent can be a little difficult for some students, but I was able to understand him clearly. His exams aren't easy, but always fair and over material that he covered in class. Online homework is extensive, but is also more difficult than the exams. He is willing to give extensions and provide homework help if needed",4.0,4.0,"Aug 3rd, 2016",679057
14836,"Dr Z has an excellent teaching style regarding science in general because he focuses on concepts rather than right answers. My first exam I got a 48 by the end of PHY232 I was scoring in the 90s and ended up with an A. It's a hard class, don't get me wrong, but he makes it fun. His lectures are very applicable to real life. Pay attention and study",5.0,4.0,"Jul 12th, 2016",679057
14837,"Exceedingly fair grader on very difficult exams (never leave a question blank--you'll get points for writing something down).

I wish I could take another one of his classes; simply excellent.",4.0,3.0,"Dec 30th, 2014",679057
14838,"Dr. Z is the most caring professor I've had so far. I had a C in the class and went to him because I needed a B for my major. His tests are really hard but if you at least attempt the problem he gives a lot of credit. He emails back within minutes, no matter what time it is. Definitely recommend him.

14845,"Zurkey is a nice professor very understanding when it comes to personal matters, will help you if you ask. However, if you just don't show up to class you will not pass without a question. Must rehearse outside of class to get an A, but with some work the class isn't too hard. Doesn't test too often but when he does make sure you are prepared!!",3.0,3.0,"Nov 13th, 2019",2512033
